## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: The build and the cut share one list of prose rules

`skills/mf-build/SKILL.md` SHALL own the prose rules: a `## Prose rules` section whose table rows are the rules,
one per row, the first cell holding the rule's id in bold (`**P1**`). `skills/mf-cut-change/SKILL.md` SHALL
carry a `## Prose rules` section with a row for the same ids. The two id sets SHALL be equal, non-empty, and
numbered from `P1` with no gap.

#### Scenario: The two skills carry the same prose-rule ids
- **Key:** `sdd:prose-rules:ids-agree`
- **Layers:** unit
- **WHEN** the ids are read from the first cell of each table row in the `## Prose rules` section of both
  skills
- **THEN** the two sets are equal and non-empty
- **AND** they run from `P1` upward with no number missing
