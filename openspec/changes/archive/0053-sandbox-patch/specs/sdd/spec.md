## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: A worker runs in an OS sandbox

A Claude worker SHALL run with Claude Code's sandbox on, `allowUnsandboxedCommands` false and `failIfUnavailable` true, writing
only to the primary, the open worktrees and the common directory: a sandbox that cannot start SHALL end the worker, never run
it unsandboxed. The operator's credential paths SHALL be denied to its scripts and to its `Read` tool,
and the credential variables unset for its scripts. It SHALL load user settings alone, so a project's settings, hooks and
`.mcp.json`, which a worker can write, start nothing. Its network SHALL reach only `pypi.org`, `files.pythonhosted.org` and the
domains `AGENTS.md`'s `Ship network:` line names. A Codex worker SHALL run with its network off, and SHALL start with its
working directory and every tree it reaches marked untrusted, whatever the operator's Codex config says, so a project's
`.codex/` config, hooks and rules, which a worker can write, start nothing. Both SHALL keep `uv`'s cache
in the run directory.

#### Scenario: A script tries to leave
- **WHEN** a worker or its subagent runs a script that writes outside its reach, reads `~/.ssh`, reads a credential variable and
  calls an unlisted domain, the npm registry among them
- **THEN** each fails, on Claude; on Codex the read may pass, and that is a stated gap

#### Scenario: A worker uses its Read tool on a credential
- **WHEN** a Claude worker or its subagent calls `Read` on a path under `~/.ssh`
- **THEN** the call is denied, and the report lists the denial

#### Scenario: A worker plants a start-up
- **WHEN** a worker leaves a `SessionStart` hook in `.claude/settings.local.json`, or a server in `.mcp.json`
- **THEN** neither runs at the next Claude start

#### Scenario: A worker plants a Codex project config
- **WHEN** a worker leaves an `[mcp_servers]` entry in `.codex/config.toml`, in a tree the operator's Codex config trusts
- **THEN** it does not run at the next Codex worker's start
- **AND** no Codex worker's start writes a trust entry to the operator's Codex config

#### Scenario: The sandbox cannot start
- **WHEN** a Claude worker starts on a machine where Claude Code's sandbox cannot start
- **THEN** the worker ends without running a command, and its version halts on the exit

### Requirement: The ship station judges every station from disk

`skills/mf-ship/scripts/conduct.py` SHALL decide each version's stage from git and the run directory alone, and SHALL
pass a station only when the worker exits 0 and its check on disk passes — never on the worker's report. The converge
check SHALL need `done` as the newest run's latest status-log event. Before the
first station it SHALL run a probe worker that must edit, commit and run `make gate` in a scratch repo, or halt. The scratch
gate's recipe SHALL try a write to a file `conduct.py` made outside the worker's reach, and SHALL pass only when that write is
refused; `conduct.py` SHALL halt the run when the file changed, and SHALL remove it.
It SHALL log every worker's start, end and check to `.minions/runs/<stamp>.md`, and `conduct.py log --verify` SHALL
fail on a worker with no end, a run that ends on neither `halt` nor `done`, or an unknown event.

#### Scenario: A worker reports success that disk does not show
- **WHEN** a build worker exits 0 and a `## Progress` box is still unticked
- **THEN** the build check fails and the version halts

#### Scenario: A run's log is complete
- **WHEN** a run ends
- **THEN** `conduct.py log --verify` exits 0 on its log

#### Scenario: A worker dies after clean findings
- **WHEN** a converge worker exits 1 with both findings files clean at `HEAD` and no `done` in its status log
- **THEN** the version halts, naming the exit, and nothing is released

#### Scenario: A probe worker runs unsandboxed
- **WHEN** the probe worker's write outside its reach lands
- **THEN** the run halts naming the probe's executor, no version starts a worker, and the file is gone

### Requirement: No worker pushes

Under `merge=yes`, `skills/mf-release/SKILL.md` SHALL stop after its merge in the primary, and `conduct.py` SHALL push, through
the tagged-merges rule, before it judges the release. A hand release SHALL push as today. `conduct.py` SHALL make each remote
call from a scratch git directory outside every worker's reach, reading no repo's config. Before a run's first worker it SHALL
keep `origin`'s URLs in the home folder, outside every worker's reach, a file that stands staying, and SHALL push only to them.
Before it starts a version's release worker, it SHALL record that version's head in a **release ledger** in the same folder, and
SHALL push a release only when its release commit's parent is a head the ledger holds that is not yet reachable from `origin`'s
default branch, as `origin` lists it. It SHALL judge that from the commits alone, reading no ref, replace ref, graft or `shallow`
file a worker writes. The default branch it pushes and judges against SHALL be the one `origin`'s own `HEAD` names, read
through the kept URLs and kept beside them at a repo's first read; a push SHALL halt when `origin`'s `HEAD` names another.
It SHALL log each entry in the run log, and no check SHALL read that copy.
It SHALL make no remote call, in a run or in `status`, `check` or `report`, while `origin` differs from the kept URLs, and only a
person SHALL clear that, repointing `origin` or removing the file. A run that read an `origin` SHALL halt, making no remote call,
when the repo's git config or `info/attributes` differs from its first read, naming the file and a key off the list naming itself.
`status`, `check`,
`report`, `stop` and `grant` SHALL halt, making no remote call, when git names a repo outside the folder they run in and no run
kept that repo's URLs. `status`, `check` and `report` SHALL make no remote call for a repo no run kept, wherever they run: a first
read SHALL be a run's alone. For such a repo with a merged version tag, `status` SHALL print `run · unread`, so a run starts for what
it cannot read, and a run past its first pushes SHALL keep the URLs, with a version or none. The git `conduct.py` runs itself SHALL
fetch no missing object from a promisor remote.

#### Scenario: A release under mf-ship
- **WHEN** a release worker merges under `merge=yes`
- **THEN** it pushes nothing, the conductor logs a `push` event, and the release check passes
- **AND** the ledger holds no entry for that version afterwards

#### Scenario: A worker forges a release
- **WHEN** a worker commits `chore(release): v9.9.9` on a side branch, tags it, and merges it into the default branch with the
  same tree
- **THEN** the run halts naming the merge, and `origin` receives nothing

#### Scenario: A worker moves the local remote ref
- **WHEN** a worker points `refs/remotes/origin/<default>` at a plain commit on the default branch
- **THEN** the run reads `origin`'s head from `origin`, halts naming that commit, and `origin` receives nothing

#### Scenario: A worker forges a release on a landed head
- **WHEN** a release landed on `origin` — pushed by a run, pushed by a person after a failed push, or finished by a person by
  hand — and a worker merges a forged release whose parent is that release's head
- **THEN** the run halts naming the merge, and `origin` receives nothing

#### Scenario: A worker points the default branch elsewhere
- **WHEN** a worker points `refs/remotes/origin/HEAD` at an older `origin` branch, and merges there a forged release on a head
  that landed on `origin`'s default branch
- **THEN** the run judges against the branch `origin`'s `HEAD` names, pushes only that branch, and exits clean, and `origin`
  receives nothing
- **AND WHEN** `origin`'s own `HEAD` names a branch other than the kept one
- **THEN** a push halts naming both, and `origin` receives nothing

#### Scenario: A worker rewrites local history
- **WHEN** a worker adds a replace ref, a graft or a `shallow` entry that gives a forged merge a ledger head as its parent
- **THEN** the run halts naming the merge, and `origin` receives nothing

#### Scenario: A worker repoints origin during a run
- **WHEN** a worker sets `remote.origin.url` to another network URL
- **THEN** the run halts naming the changed file, and that host receives nothing

#### Scenario: A release worker plants a key off the list
- **WHEN** a release worker leaves such a key in a repo with an `origin`
- **THEN** the run halts naming the key, and makes no remote call

#### Scenario: A repoint outlasts the run
- **WHEN** a run stopped with `origin` repointed, and `status`, `check`, `report` or a new run follows
- **THEN** each that would make a remote call halts naming the file that keeps the URLs, and that host receives nothing
- **AND WHEN** a person repoints `origin`, or removes that file
- **THEN** the next run goes on, and a removed file keeps what that run reads

#### Scenario: A worker redirects git to another repo
- **WHEN** a `commondir` file, or a swapped `.git`, leaves git naming a repo no run kept, outside the folder they run in, its
  `origin` on another host
- **THEN** `status`, `check` and `report` halt, and that host receives nothing
- **AND WHEN** a person removes the redirect
- **THEN** each reads the primary again
- **AND WHEN** a `commondir` file, a `.git` file, or a whole repo at `.git`, leaves git naming a repo inside a linked worktree
- **THEN** that host receives nothing

#### Scenario: No run kept the repo
- **WHEN** `status`, `check` or `report` runs in a repo with an `origin` no run kept
- **THEN** none makes a remote call: `status` names no tag, and `check` and `report` read a tag as not on `origin`
- **AND WHEN** a run starts there, even where the home folder refuses the file
- **THEN** it reads `origin` itself, for its pushes and its release check

#### Scenario: A tag alone in a repo no run kept
- **WHEN** `main` is level with `origin`, a merged tag is not on it, and no run kept the repo
- **THEN** `status` prints `run · unread`, and `mf-ship` starts a run, which pushes the tag and keeps the URLs
- **AND WHEN** `status` runs again
- **THEN** it reads `origin` itself, and prints no such line
- **AND WHEN** a repo with an `origin` no run kept holds no merged version tag
- **THEN** `status` prints `status: none — no open version`, and no run starts

#### Scenario: A worker sets a key after the refusal
- **WHEN** a key that names a program stands in the repo's config after the refusal read it clean
- **THEN** the conductor's remote calls and pushes do not run that program

#### Scenario: A worker plants a promisor remote
- **WHEN** a worker sets `remote.<name>.promisor`, and deletes a blob `conduct.py` reads
- **THEN** that read fails, and the remote's URL receives nothing
- **AND** the key halts the run where any key off the list does

### Requirement: A re-run recovers what a dead station left

A re-run of `mf-ship` SHALL finish what a dead worker or conductor left. An open merge with no note SHALL be stage
`integrate`. Under `merge=yes`, `skills/mf-release/SKILL.md` SHALL restore a tree dirty with only its own fold and a staged
archive move to `HEAD`, then start over; a hand release SHALL keep its clean-tree halt. It SHALL re-enter at its merge after reading its preamble against the archived delta, halting on a flag under `merge=yes` and naming it beside the ask by hand,
tagging `HEAD` first when the tag is missing, when `HEAD` is its release commit, converge was clean at `HEAD~1` and the
default branch has not moved. `conduct.py` SHALL read that stage as `release` only when the run logs show the release
worker died and the person left no `.minions/release/<change-id>.held` mark, and as `released` for any other release tip. It SHALL read `tasks.md` from `HEAD`. It SHALL, at the start of
a run, push the default branch and each merged tag `origin` lacks, only when every first-parent commit past `origin`'s default
branch, as `origin` lists it, is a merge of a tagged release holding that release's tree, whose release commit's parent is a
head the release ledger holds that is not yet on `origin`, and every such tag is on such a release commit, and SHALL else halt, naming the commit or the
tag; an `origin` it cannot read SHALL halt the push. It SHALL push the sha it checked, never force, a rejected push halting the
run; `status`
SHALL report that work, so a run starts for it. It SHALL make no remote call, merge nothing into a dependent, and read no
tree's status or diff, while the repo's own git config holds a key off its list of keys that name no program, with an
`origin` or without one. It SHALL make no remote call while `origin`'s
fetch or push URL is not a network URL. The claim
`.minions/runs/active` SHALL hold the conductor's pid with its start time, and each worker's process
group with its leader's start time: a pid at or below 1, a dead pid or one that lost its start time is a stale claim, whose
groups a run kills, each only while its leader keeps that start time and names an executor, before it clears the claim and
starts, and `status` SHALL name it. A group that keeps its start time and names no executor SHALL stop the run, naming the
group and keeping the claim, and a run SHALL clear a stale claim before it detaches, so that stop reaches its caller. A start
time SHALL read the same in any zone or locale. A pid `ps` cannot read that still runs is no stale claim: `status`, `run` and
`/mf-ship stop` SHALL exit 2, naming it, and signal nothing, and a run that cannot read its own start time SHALL stop.

#### Scenario: A release dies before its commit
- **WHEN** a release worker dies with its fold staged and the change's folder moved
- **THEN** a re-run reads the stage as `release`, restores the tree, and releases with one tag

#### Scenario: A release dies after its commit
- **WHEN** a release worker dies between its commit and its tag, and the default branch has not moved
- **THEN** a re-run reads the stage as `release`, tags `HEAD`, merges and pushes

#### Scenario: A release dies after its tag
- **WHEN** a release worker dies after its commit and tag, and the default branch has not moved
- **THEN** a re-run merges and pushes
- **AND WHEN** the default branch has moved
- **THEN** the stage is `released`, a halt naming the person's recovery

#### Scenario: A release stopped on purpose stays stopped
- **WHEN** a release tip's worker exited 0 before its merge, or a person ran the release and said no
- **THEN** the stage is `released`, a halt naming `/mf-release`, and a re-run merges nothing

#### Scenario: A tip forges a release
- **WHEN** a version's tip says `chore(release): <tag>` and the tag is on another commit
- **THEN** the stage is `released`, and a re-run merges nothing

#### Scenario: A hand release finds uncommitted edits
- **WHEN** a person runs `mf-release` with edits uncommitted under `openspec/` or in `CHANGELOG.md`
- **THEN** the clean-tree precondition halts, and nothing is restored

#### Scenario: A person takes a flagged release
- **WHEN** a person runs `mf-release` on a release tip whose preamble is flagged
- **THEN** it reads the flag, does not halt on it, and names it beside the ask before the merge

#### Scenario: A release dies before its push
- **WHEN** the default branch is ahead of `origin` with a run's release, and no version is open
- **THEN** `status` names the unpushed work, and a run pushes it and ends on `done`

#### Scenario: A hand release left unpushed
- **WHEN** the default branch holds a release a person merged by hand, and `origin` lacks it
- **THEN** a run halts naming the merge and `git push`, and pushes nothing

#### Scenario: The repo's config names a command
- **WHEN** the repo's own git config holds `remote.origin.uploadpack`, and `origin` exists
- **THEN** `status` exits 1 naming the key, a run halts, and the conductor makes no remote call

#### Scenario: The repo's config holds an unlisted key
- **WHEN** the repo's own git config holds a `hook.*` key, or any key off the list
- **THEN** `status` exits 1 naming the key, a run halts, and no hook runs on a push or a dependent's merge

#### Scenario: A worker plants a filter
- **WHEN** a worker leaves a `filter.*` key in the repo's config, over a stat-dirty tracked file
- **THEN** the check that follows halts its version naming the key, and the filter never runs

#### Scenario: A worker repoints origin at a local repo
- **WHEN** `origin`'s URL is a local path or a `file://` URL
- **THEN** `status` exits 1, a run halts, the conductor makes no remote call, and that repo's hooks do not run

#### Scenario: The conductor is killed
- **WHEN** `.minions/runs/active` holds a dead pid and a live worker group
- **THEN** `status` reads `stale`, and a run kills the group, clears the claim and starts

#### Scenario: A claim outlives a reboot
- **WHEN** a stale claim names a group whose leader's start time is not the one the entry holds
- **THEN** a run leaves that group alive, and clears the claim

#### Scenario: A claimed group names no executor
- **WHEN** a stale claim names a group that keeps its start time, and whose leader names no executor
- **THEN** a run, detached or not, kills the claim's executors, stops naming that group, and keeps the claim

#### Scenario: A running conductor cannot be read
- **WHEN** `ps` prints nothing for the claim's pid, and that process still runs
- **THEN** `status`, `run` and `/mf-ship stop` exit 2 naming the pid, nothing is signalled, and the claim stays

#### Scenario: The time zone changes during a run
- **WHEN** `TZ` differs between the run's write of its start time and a later read
- **THEN** `status` still reads `live`

#### Scenario: A person's local commit on the default branch
- **WHEN** `main` holds a commit that is no merge of a tagged release, and `origin` lacks it
- **THEN** a run halts naming the commit, and pushes nothing

#### Scenario: A merge a release check refused
- **WHEN** `main` holds a merge of a tagged release whose tree is not that release's, and `origin` lacks it
- **THEN** a run halts naming the merge, and pushes nothing

#### Scenario: A person's version-shaped tag
- **WHEN** `main` reaches a `vX.Y.Z` tag `origin` lacks, on no `chore(release): vX.Y.Z` commit
- **THEN** a run halts naming the tag, and pushes nothing

#### Scenario: A flagged release dies
- **WHEN** a release flags its preamble, commits and dies
- **THEN** a re-run halts on the flag before its merge

### Requirement: Every worktree shares the primary's run directory

Every station and bundled script SHALL resolve the run directory as `.minions/` beside the primary checkout's git
directory — `git rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-common-dir`, its parent — from any worktree of the
repository. `conduct.py` alone SHALL halt on that answer outside the repo it names until a run has kept that repo's URLs: a worker
can write what steers it. Converge and the release SHALL write `.minions/backlog.md` only while holding `.minions/backlog.lock`,
created with `mkdir`, halting after two minutes of waiting and naming the lock. A run holding the claim SHALL remove a
`backlog.lock` older than ten minutes before its first worker, and log it.

#### Scenario: A release in a linked worktree after a converge in another
- **WHEN** converge ran in one worktree of a change and the release runs in another worktree of the same repository
- **THEN** the release reads the same findings files, and does not read converge as skipped

#### Scenario: Two converges write the backlog
- **WHEN** a converge reaches Step 9 while another holds `.minions/backlog.lock`
- **THEN** it waits, writes once the lock is free, and removes the lock after its write

#### Scenario: A dead worker left the lock
- **WHEN** a run starts and `.minions/backlog.lock` is older than ten minutes
- **THEN** the run removes it and logs the removal before its first worker
- **AND WHEN** the lock is younger
- **THEN** the run leaves it

### Requirement: Converge continues an unfinished run

When the newest run of a status log ends on neither `halt` nor `done`, `conduct.py`'s stage SHALL be `converge`, whatever
the findings files say, and `skills/mf-converge/SKILL.md` SHALL continue that run from its latest event: no new `## Run`
heading, the round unchanged, and a pickup whose fix was never committed sent again. A run whose top line is a `halt` naming
`.minions/backlog.lock` SHALL be continued the same way, at Step 9, when both findings files are clean at `HEAD`.

#### Scenario: A usage limit stops converge mid-pickup
- **WHEN** a run's latest event is `pickup` and its findings files are clean at `HEAD`
- **THEN** a re-run of `mf-ship` spawns converge, not the release
- **AND** the same run sends the pickup, verifies, writes the backlog and ends on `done`, repeating no judged round

#### Scenario: A converge halted on the backlog lock
- **WHEN** a run's top line is a `halt` naming `.minions/backlog.lock`, and both findings files are clean at `HEAD`
- **THEN** a re-run of `mf-ship` spawns converge, which writes the backlog and ends on `done` in the same run, with no new round
- **AND WHEN** either findings file is not clean at `HEAD`
- **THEN** converge halts, naming it

### Requirement: A halt stops only its version, and a re-run resumes

A failed check SHALL halt its version alone: that version SHALL start no new worker, and every other version SHALL go on
to its release. A version whose `after:` names a halted or blocked version SHALL be blocked, starting no worker. A failed
probe and a conductor crash SHALL stop the run. A run with every open version at a halt stage or `waiting` SHALL start
no worker, the probe included. A `**HUMAN` phase, a dependency waiting for approval,
converge's cap, an open integrate merge, a red gate, a release stopped before its merge, and a worker past its timeout
SHALL each halt their version.

Each halt SHALL be logged when it happens, and each block as `blocked — by <id>`. A run with a halt or a block SHALL
close on `run · halt — halted <ids> · blocked <ids> · released <tags>` and exit 1. `conduct.py report` SHALL print every
`halt` line, then the closing line, and SHALL end a blocked version's line with `blocked by <id>`. The run SHALL keep no state
outside git and the run directory, except the claim, `origin`'s URLs and the release ledger in the home folder: a re-run derives
every stage again and continues. A halt SHALL need
the person only at a stage in `HALTS`, a `**HUMAN` phase, a merge with a note, a converge that halted on anything but
`.minions/backlog.lock`, a release whose
base moved, a release stopped on purpose or refused, a repo git config key or local `origin` the run refuses, a git config that
changed during the run, an `origin` that left the kept URLs, or a default-branch commit no ledger entry stands behind. A worker
stopped by a usage limit SHALL be halted with its reset time named.

#### Scenario: A HUMAN phase halts its version
- **WHEN** a version's first unticked phase is marked `**HUMAN`
- **THEN** that version halts, naming the phase, and every other version goes on

#### Scenario: A later version halts, and the earlier ships
- **WHEN** two versions run and the later one's build check fails
- **THEN** the earlier is released, merged and pushed
- **AND** the run closes naming the later as halted and the earlier's tag as released, and exits 1

#### Scenario: A later version ships past a halted one
- **WHEN** two versions run and the earlier one's build check fails
- **THEN** the later is released, merged and pushed
- **AND** the run closes naming the earlier as halted and the later's tag as released, and exits 1

#### Scenario: A halted dependency blocks a chain
- **WHEN** a version halts, a second has it in `after:`, and a third has the second in `after:`
- **THEN** neither starts a worker, each logs `blocked — by <id>`, and the closing line names both as blocked

#### Scenario: No open version can start
- **WHEN** one version sits at a `**HUMAN` phase, and every other is `waiting`
- **THEN** the run starts no worker, and closes naming the first as halted and the others as blocked

#### Scenario: A failed probe stops the run
- **WHEN** the probe's check fails
- **THEN** no version starts a worker, and the run closes naming `run` as halted

#### Scenario: The person re-runs after a halt
- **WHEN** the person handles the halt and runs `mf-ship` again
- **THEN** each version continues from its stage on disk, and the finished stations do not run again

#### Scenario: The person resolves a semantic conflict
- **WHEN** integrate halted on a semantic conflict or a red gate, with the merge open and its note under
  `.minions/integrate/`
- **THEN** a re-run of `mf-ship` halts again and integrates nothing, whatever the person staged
- **AND WHEN** the person settles it and `/mf-integrate <change-id>` commits the merge
- **THEN** a re-run of `mf-ship` runs the catch-up round, then the release

#### Scenario: Grant takes only the cap
- **WHEN** a person runs `/mf-ship grant <change-id>` on a version halted on anything but converge's cap
- **THEN** it exits 2, and records nothing

### Requirement: Anchored harms block, and drift has its own tier

`skills/mf-converge/SKILL.md` SHALL name the **anchors** — data loss or an irreversible delete, spend, exposure of
personal data or secrets, silent wrong output — and SHALL grade an anchored finding `blocking` in review and at least
`high` in security, save a route in a class the threat model's *Out of scope* accepts by name, which is carded and does
not block, anchors included. Review SHALL grade `blocking | drift | nit`, where `drift` is docs, comments, README or CHANGELOG
text the code contradicts; `drift` SHALL NOT block. A spec scenario the code contradicts SHALL stay `blocking`.

#### Scenario: Converge and the method page name the anchors and the drift tier
- **WHEN** review or security finds data loss or an irreversible delete, spend, exposure of personal data or
  secrets, or silent wrong output
- **THEN** review grades it `blocking` and security at least `high`, so the loop fixes it

#### Scenario: Prose the code contradicts
- **WHEN** review finds docs, comments, README or CHANGELOG text the code contradicts
- **THEN** it grades the finding `drift`, which does not block
- **AND** a spec scenario the code contradicts stays `blocking`

#### Scenario: A route in the accepted class
- **WHEN** security finds a route in a class the threat model's *Out of scope* accepts by name, with an anchored harm
- **THEN** it cards the route, and the card does not block
- **AND WHEN** the route is in no accepted class
- **THEN** the anchor blocks as before
