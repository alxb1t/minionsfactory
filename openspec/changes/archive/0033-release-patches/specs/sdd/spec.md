## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: A test is deleted or merged only as the design's table names it

`skills/mf-build/SKILL.md` SHALL treat a test deleted or merged as the change's `design.md` `## Tests` table names it
— each removed test mapped to the remaining test that carries its assertions and scenario ids, or to a decision
in force at the base that retires it — as consolidation, not as weakening the gate, and SHALL halt on a deletion outside that table.
`skills/mf-cut-change/SKILL.md` SHALL write that table for every test a change deletes or merges. The fix station
in `skills/mf-converge/SKILL.md` SHALL never delete or merge a test.

#### Scenario: The build names the table, and the fix station never deletes
- **WHEN** a phase deletes a test that `design.md`'s `## Tests` table maps to a decision in force at the base that retires it
- **THEN** `mf-build` treats the deletion as consolidation and does not halt

#### Scenario: A deletion outside the table
- **WHEN** a phase deletes a test the table does not name
- **THEN** `mf-build` halts: the gate would be weakened

#### Scenario: A fix pass meets a test
- **WHEN** the fix station clears a finding
- **THEN** it deletes and merges no test

### Requirement: Review judges test cost and traced coverage

The review station SHALL run a **test-cost pass** after its engine, carding each new end-to-end test that a lower
layer proves, that re-opens a state another test reaches, or that runs on engines its outcome cannot depend on. When
the freeze removes a test, it SHALL run a **coverage-trace pass**, tracing each removed assertion and scenario id to
the test that runs it now, or to the decision, in force at the base, that the design's `## Tests` table names as retiring it. A
proof carried by neither SHALL be `blocking`. Each round SHALL run both passes over that round's freeze. The
station SHALL say in its Summary that each pass ran, and `skills/mf-converge/SKILL.md` SHALL check that it did.

#### Scenario: Converge names both passes where they run and where they are checked
- **WHEN** a review findings file's Summary does not say the test-cost pass ran, or the coverage-trace pass ran or
  the freeze removed no test
- **THEN** `mf-converge` treats it as a scope failure and halts

#### Scenario: The freeze removes a test the table retires
- **WHEN** the freeze removes a test that the `## Tests` table maps to a decision in force at the base
- **THEN** the coverage-trace pass accepts the removal and cards nothing for it

#### Scenario: A proof carried by neither
- **WHEN** a removed assertion maps to no remaining test and to no retiring decision
- **THEN** review cards it `blocking`

### Requirement: A metric is a Python script the collector runs without a shell

Each `[[metric]]` in `metrics/catalogue.toml` SHALL declare `id`, `title`, `group`, `unit` and `better`
(`lower` or `higher`), MAY declare `watch` and `noise`, and SHALL declare either `script` with `args` or
`source = "station"`. The collector SHALL run a metric's script as `uv run --script <script> <args>` from the
repository root, never through a shell, with a 300-second timeout. A run that exits 0 with a number on its last
stdout line SHALL record that number; any other outcome SHALL record `unavailable` with its reason. A failing
metric SHALL NOT fail the station. A catalogue that does not parse, lacks a required field, repeats an `id`, or
names a `script` that is not a path inside the repository — a URL, an absolute path, a path escaping the root, or
one starting with `-` — SHALL halt the station, naming the entry.

#### Scenario: A metric script prints its value
- **WHEN** a metric's script exits 0 and its last stdout line is a number
- **THEN** the data file records that number for the metric's `id`

#### Scenario: A metric script fails
- **WHEN** a metric's script exits non-zero, prints no number, or runs past its timeout
- **THEN** the data file records `unavailable` with the reason
- **AND** the station carries on with the other metrics

#### Scenario: The catalogue is broken
- **WHEN** the catalogue does not parse, an entry lacks a required field, two entries share an `id`, or a `script`
  is not a path inside the repository or starts with `-`
- **THEN** the station halts, naming the entry
