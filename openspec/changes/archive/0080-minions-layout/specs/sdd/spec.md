## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Converge keeps a status log

`skills/mf-converge/SKILL.md` SHALL have the conductor write `.minions/changes/<change-id>/status_log.md`: one line
per event, in the form `HH:MM:SS · round N · <event> — <detail>`, the time taken from `date`. Each run SHALL open
with a `## Run N` heading placed above the previous run, and each event SHALL be inserted directly under the latest
heading, so the newest run and the newest line are on top. No line SHALL be edited or deleted. The events SHALL be
`start`, `freeze`, `fan-out`, `verdicts`, `fix`, `verify`, `pickup`, `catch-up`, `by rule`, `debt`, `halt` and
`done`, and a run SHALL end on `halt` or `done`. Each `verdicts` line SHALL name one role and end `executor <x> · model <m> ·
effort <e> · tokens <n>`, the executor, model and effort from the version's models file, else the run's, and `tokens` the
worker's figure or `unavailable`. The log SHALL NOT be a findings file: no station writes it and no
release reads it.

#### Scenario: Converge names the log, its order and its events
- **WHEN** `mf-converge` dispatches, receives or decides
- **THEN** it inserts one line for that event under the latest `## Run N` heading, its time taken from `date`
- **AND** the newest run and the newest line are on top, and no earlier line changes

#### Scenario: A round's verdicts
- **WHEN** a round's review and security files are read
- **THEN** the log holds one `verdicts` line for each role, each naming that role's executor, model and effort

#### Scenario: A converge run stops
- **WHEN** the run halts or finishes
- **THEN** its last event is `halt`, with the reason, or `done`

#### Scenario: A catch-up by rule
- **WHEN** every merge of a catch-up replays by the fixed rules
- **THEN** the log holds one `by rule` line, `clean` and each merge's paths, and no `fan-out` or `verdicts` line for the round

### Requirement: Converge and the release halt on a gate the cut did not plan

`skills/mf-converge/SKILL.md` and `skills/mf-release/SKILL.md` SHALL each run
`skills/mf-converge/scripts/gate_check.py` before judging or releasing, and SHALL halt on its verdict. The script
SHALL export the base and `HEAD` with `git archive` into fresh directories under `.minions/changes/<change-id>/gate-check/`, run make
there with `MAKEFLAGS` and `MFLAGS` cleared, and remove them when it ends. A **gate makefile** SHALL be any file in
the `MAKEFILE_LIST` or a `Reading makefile` line of `make -pn -r -w -d gate` on either export. When no sub-task in
`tasks.md` as the cut commit holds it names both `Makefile` and `` `gate` ``, a branch that changes a gate makefile,
or the `make -n gate` output, SHALL halt. When such a task exists, the script SHALL show the two exports'
`make -n gate` diff, and SHALL halt on a command line the base prints and the branch does not, and on every
non-blank gate makefile line the branch adds or removes, unless that task quotes the line. Its verdict SHALL
name what it read — the gate makefiles and the dry runs — and SHALL NOT state that the gate is the base's. A halt SHALL
list every unquoted line in one run, the halt with no planning task among them; SHALL say that `` `gate` `` must be in
backticks and that the cut commit is what counts; SHALL say whether the dry run changed or the file alone; and SHALL name
`/mf-ship approve-gate <change-id> <hash>` as the way out, `<hash>` the hash of what that run read. With no planning task, the
halt SHALL list each line the branch's dry run adds, and SHALL list the dry run itself when nothing else is listed. A person's
approval recorded in the home folder for the change, whose hash equals the hash of each gate makefile's unified diff, line
numbers included, and the dry runs' diff the script reads, SHALL pass the script without a planning task. An export that lacks a path of its tree, or a dry run that fails on either export, SHALL halt, naming the
side. The cut commit SHALL be the one commit that adds the change's `design.md`; more than one SHALL be a
halt.

#### Scenario: Both stations name the dry-run check
- **WHEN** a branch changes a gate makefile — an included makefile, a sub-make's makefile, a recipe line given a
  `-` prefix, a `.IGNORE` target, or `-i` in `MAKEFLAGS` — or a file that changes the gate's dry run, and no cut task
  names the gate recipe
- **THEN** `mf-converge` halts before judging, and `mf-release` before releasing

#### Scenario: A planned gate change drops a command
- **WHEN** a cut task names the gate recipe, and the base's dry run prints a command line the branch's does not
- **THEN** each station shows the two dry runs' diff and halts, unless that task quotes the line

#### Scenario: A planned change adds a line the task does not quote
- **WHEN** a cut task names the gate recipe, and the branch adds or removes a gate makefile line the task does not
  quote — a removed `SHELL := /bin/bash -o pipefail`; an added `-` recipe prefix, a `.IGNORE` target, a `SHELL` assignment or `-i` in `MAKEFLAGS`, in any form: a continued rule
  line, `define`, a computed name, `$(eval)`
- **THEN** each station halts, naming the line

#### Scenario: The base's gate reads a file the export lacks
- **WHEN** either export lacks a path of its tree — an `export-ignore` path — or `make -pn -r -w -d gate` or
  `make -n gate` fails in it — an included `.env`
- **THEN** each station halts, naming the side and the failure, and compares nothing in the working tree

#### Scenario: The halt lists every unquoted line
- **WHEN** a branch adds a `setup` target and edits `.PHONY`, and no cut task names `` `gate` ``
- **THEN** the halt lists each added and removed line, says the dry run is unchanged, and names `approve-gate` with the hash

#### Scenario: A dry run gains a line with no plan
- **WHEN** no cut task names `` `gate` ``, no gate makefile changes, and the branch's dry run prints a line the base's does not
- **THEN** the script halts, naming the added line

#### Scenario: A person approves a gate change
- **WHEN** a person's approval recorded in the home folder holds the hash of the branch's gate makefile diffs and dry-run diff
- **THEN** the script passes, naming the approval
- **AND WHEN** the branch changes or moves a gate makefile line after the approval
- **THEN** the hashes differ, and the script halts as with no approval

#### Scenario: A branch writes its own approval
- **WHEN** a file in the repository, the run directory or the version's tree claims an approval
- **THEN** the script reads none of it, and halts as with no approval

### Requirement: No station deletes a findings file or the diff patch

`skills/mf-converge/SKILL.md` and `skills/mf-release/SKILL.md` SHALL each forbid deleting, moving, renaming or
emptying a findings file or the diff patch; clearing them SHALL be the human's act. The run's start-of-run move of an old
layout into `.minions/changes/<change-id>/`, before any worker, is no station's act.

#### Scenario: Both stations carry the rule
- **WHEN** `mf-converge` or `mf-release` ends, clean or on a halt
- **THEN** every findings file and the diff patch are still at their paths, unmoved and not emptied

### Requirement: Model suggestions use exposed capabilities

The cut SHALL bound model suggestions by the target's declared menu or the models exposed in the session.
It SHALL suggest an effort setting only when that setting is supported. With no model menu it SHALL state the
needed capability without inventing model names; with no effort control it SHALL omit the effort setting.
It SHALL write the suggestion to `.minions/changes/<change-id>/models.toml`, a table per station, as well as show it, and
SHALL never write it into the change. Authentication and provider configuration SHALL remain the operator's
responsibility.

#### Scenario: The session exposes no model menu or effort control
- **WHEN** the cut produces its station suggestions
- **THEN** it describes the required model capability and omits unsupported controls
- **AND** it does not change the session's selected model or provider configuration

#### Scenario: The cut records its suggestion
- **WHEN** the cut commits a change
- **THEN** `.minions/changes/<change-id>/models.toml` holds a `build`, a `converge` and a `release` table, each with its
  `model`, and nothing under `openspec/changes/<change-id>/` names a model

### Requirement: The integrate station merges the default branch into the next version

`skills/mf-integrate/SKILL.md` SHALL, run in the primary checkout, take the version `change-id` names, or with none the
ready version with the lowest change id among the unmerged branches named by a change id that hold their change or a
release commit. It SHALL halt, naming the version, when the named one is not ready, or when none is: a phase unticked,
converge not clean, or an `after:` id missing from its tree. A named version whose merge is open with its note SHALL be
ready. It SHALL merge the default branch into that version's worktree, resolve each additive hunk git leaves — one whose union
keeps every addition and every removal of both sides and changes nothing else, whether its edits separate as lines, list
items or sentences — and a merged test the union breaks when the fix keeps both sides' intent, commit the merge with the version's
`Change:` trailer, its body naming each resolved hunk: the file, both
sides' intent and the union, then run `make gate` on the worktree through `skills/mf-converge/scripts/gate_run.py --tree
<worktree>`, and end with `Next: /mf-converge, then /mf-release`, or with `Next: /mf-ship, in the primary.` for a version with an
unticked phase. A red gate on a merged test the union broke SHALL be fixed once, when the fix keeps both sides' intent, by amending
the merge commit when it is `HEAD`, or, past the person's fix, by a commit of its own naming the test fixed, and gated again. Any other red gate SHALL halt with the merge committed and write
`.minions/changes/<change-id>/integrate.red` holding `head: <sha>`, the head the gate judged; with no merge open, `conduct.py` SHALL read
the version as halted while that sha is `HEAD`, and as to integrate again once it is not. Its integrate check SHALL fail while that
`.red` stands, and read the newest first-parent merge, so the person's fix commit after it passes once a green gate deletes it. It SHALL NOT release, tag, push or rebase.

#### Scenario: The next version is ready
- **WHEN** the version has every phase ticked and clean findings files
- **THEN** the station merges the default branch into its worktree, commits the merge and gates the worktree

#### Scenario: The next version is not ready
- **WHEN** `change-id` names a version with an unticked phase
- **THEN** the station halts, naming that version, and merges nothing

#### Scenario: The lowest open version is not ready, and no id is named
- **WHEN** the lowest-id open version has an unticked phase and a later one is ready
- **THEN** the station takes the later one

#### Scenario: The merged tree fails the gate
- **WHEN** `make gate` fails on the committed merge, on no test the union broke
- **THEN** the station halts with the merge committed, and `.minions/changes/<change-id>/integrate.red` names the head it gated

#### Scenario: Coverage reads only the branch's lines
- **WHEN** the default branch brought in lines the branch's tests do not cover
- **THEN** the gate after the merge commit reads the branch's own changed lines alone

#### Scenario: A settled dependent has no build yet
- **WHEN** `/mf-integrate <change-id>` commits the merge of a version with an unticked phase
- **THEN** its last line is `Next: /mf-ship, in the primary.`

#### Scenario: Both sides add in one hunk
- **WHEN** the branch adds items to a list and the default branch removes another item from it, on one line
- **THEN** the station keeps the branch's items and the removal, commits the merge, and gates the worktree
- **AND** the commit's body names the file, both sides' intent and the union

### Requirement: A semantic conflict is handed to the person with the merge open

When the delta check reports a changed requirement, or git leaves a conflict that is not additive (one side editing what the
other removed, two values for one thing, designs that disagree, a choice between behaviours),
`skills/mf-integrate/SKILL.md` SHALL halt with the merge in progress in the version's worktree, write
`.minions/changes/<change-id>/integrate.md` holding both intents and a proposed resolution, and continue from the open
merge on its next run.

#### Scenario: Both versions changed one requirement
- **WHEN** the branch's delta modifies a requirement the default branch also changed since the base
- **THEN** the merge stays open, the note names both changes, and the next run continues from `MERGE_HEAD`

#### Scenario: Two values for one thing
- **WHEN** the branch sets a constant to one value and the default branch sets it to another
- **THEN** the merge stays open, the note names both changes, and nothing is resolved

### Requirement: The ship station takes cut versions to the default branch

`skills/mf-ship/SKILL.md`, run in the primary checkout of a repo whose `AGENTS.md` declares `Worktrees:`, SHALL take
every open version to the default branch: build, then converge, for every open version at once; then, one version
at a time, in the order they are ready, integrate when its base moved, converge's catch-up round, and release with
`merge=yes`. Converge SHALL always run. Each station SHALL run as a fresh agent process of the executor the models
file names for it, or of the executor running `mf-ship`, in the version's worktree — integrate in the primary — with the model `.minions/changes/<change-id>/models.toml`
names for it, or the executor's default. A worker SHALL run in an OS sandbox, Claude Code's or Codex's workspace-write, its writes reaching the primary and
each open worktree and nothing outside them, under `conduct.py`'s allowlist on Claude Code, extended by `AGENTS.md`'s `Ship
tools:` line, its prompt carrying the shell rules, and SHALL never run with permission prompts bypassed. A denial SHALL
not halt a version by itself: the station's check decides, and the report lists every denial. Starting `mf-ship` SHALL be the person's yes to every
merge and push of the run. `conduct.py` SHALL run its own git with hooks and `core.fsmonitor` off, so a hook a worker
plants does not run at the conductor's rights. At a run's start, a version whose branch holds nothing past its cut commit,
and whose base the default branch has passed, SHALL get the default branch merged in, as a dependent does; a version with
more, an unticked phase and no merge open, whose base the default branch passed changing a gate makefile, `AGENTS.md`,
`CODING_STANDARDS.md` or `CONTRIBUTING.md`, SHALL get the default branch merged in when the merge is clean or its conflicts
are all paths `integrate.py`'s `changelog`, `decisions` and `delta` rules settle, and SHALL else halt, naming the files and
`git -C <tree> merge <default>`; one
with an unticked phase and a merge open with no note SHALL halt, naming `git -C <tree> commit`, unless it is a
dependent whose merge `conduct.py` finishes; any other version SHALL go on from its stage. After a release's check passes, `conduct.py` SHALL
remove the version's worktree, without `--force`, keeping its branch, only when its path is `AGENTS.md`'s `Worktrees:`
path joined with the change id, logging the ignored paths it held, listed by name; a listing that fails SHALL keep the
worktree, logged, and a refusal SHALL be logged, never forced.

#### Scenario: A worker plants a hook
- **WHEN** a `post-commit` hook stands in the repo and `conduct.py` commits a dependent's merge
- **THEN** the hook does not run on that commit

#### Scenario: Two cut versions ship
- **WHEN** two versions are cut, each in its own worktree, and `mf-ship` runs to the end
- **THEN** both are released, merged and pushed, the first ready first, the other integrated and judged by a
  catch-up round first, and only the primary is left

#### Scenario: A ready version ships past a slow one
- **WHEN** two versions run and the lower id is still building when the higher is ready
- **THEN** the higher is released first, and takes the lower number

#### Scenario: A worker runs a command off the list
- **WHEN** a build worker's command is denied by the allowlist and the build's check still passes
- **THEN** the run goes on, and the report lists the denial
- **AND WHEN** the build's check fails
- **THEN** the version halts, and its `halt` line names the denial

#### Scenario: No worktrees are declared
- **WHEN** `mf-ship` starts in a repo whose `AGENTS.md` declares no `Worktrees:`
- **THEN** it halts, naming the missing declaration, and starts no worker

#### Scenario: A version cut before main moved
- **WHEN** a version's branch holds only its cut commit, and the default branch has moved since
- **THEN** the run merges the default branch into it before its first worker, and builds on the merge
- **AND WHEN** the version's build has begun, and the default branch changed `Makefile` since its base
- **THEN** the run merges the default branch in when the merge is clean or conflicts only in `CHANGELOG.md`, and builds on
  the merge
- **AND WHEN** the merge conflicts in a path no rule settles
- **THEN** that version halts before its next worker, naming `Makefile` and the merge to run
- **AND WHEN** every phase is ticked
- **THEN** the version goes on from its stage, and integrate merges the default branch in
- **AND WHEN** a phase is unticked and the merge is open in its worktree with no note
- **THEN** that version halts before its next worker, naming `git -C <tree> commit` to finish the merge
- **AND WHEN** the merge is open with its note
- **THEN** that version halts as `integrating`, naming the note

#### Scenario: A released worktree
- **WHEN** a release's check passes under `mf-ship`
- **THEN** the version's worktree is gone and its branch kept, and the run logs the ignored paths it held
- **AND WHEN** git's worktree entry names a path other than the `Worktrees:` path joined with the change id
- **THEN** nothing is removed, and the run logs it
- **AND WHEN** the worktree's ignored paths cannot be listed
- **THEN** nothing is removed, and the run logs it
- **AND WHEN** the repo's git config holds a key a run refuses, or changed since the run read it
- **THEN** nothing is removed, and the run logs it
- **AND WHEN** the `Worktrees:` path joined with the change id is a link
- **THEN** nothing is removed, and the run logs it

### Requirement: The review-metrics station charts past findings, read-only

`skills/mf-review-metrics/scripts/review_metrics.py` SHALL read the repos named in
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/minionsfactory/review-metrics.toml`, else `~/.config/minionsfactory/review-metrics.toml`, or in
`--config` and `--repo`, and SHALL halt naming the config path when neither names a repo. It SHALL read each repo's
`.minions/changes/<change-id>/` files and its worker logs, `.minions/changes/<change>/logs/<stamp>-<station>.log` and
`<stamp>-<station>-<n>.log` — in a repo no run has moved, the old `.minions/findings/` and `.minions/runs/<stamp>/<change>_<station>.log`
and `-<n>.log` alike — and the operator's Codex sessions,
`~/.codex/sessions/**/*.jsonl`, without writing to any repo,
parse each field it can, record a field it cannot as a gap —
never a zero — and write one self-contained HTML page, with no script, to the config's `out` or `--out`. The page
SHALL hold a table per repo and per model, a cost table per repo — each change's stations with their dollars, turns, tokens and
seconds — charts over changes drawn by `mf-build`'s `chart()`, and the list of fields each repo lacked. A log's dollars and tokens
SHALL be its last result event's cumulative `total_cost_usd` and `modelUsage`, its turns and seconds the sum over its result events;
a station with no log and a log with no result event SHALL be a gap, and a station the run log shows spawned more times than
the logs read SHALL be marked `<read> of <spawns>`. The status log's tokens SHALL be read per role, in every form a `verdicts` line
holds; a line naming both roles SHALL be recorded under the role `both`, credited to neither. A Codex worker's tokens SHALL be read from its session — the
last `token_count` event's totals, its model and effort from `turn_context` — matched to its round by its parent's `cwd` — the change's worktree, or the primary
when no other version's round overlaps — and the round's freeze-to-verdicts window, the guardian sessions left out, and never
into a round its line names `executor claude`. It SHALL write `review-metrics.json`
beside the page: one record per round and role, with its executor, model, effort, tokens and source, a gap as `null`. It SHALL read no tier, and SHALL count a file's `inconclusive` sections only when the file holds
`## Refuted`, the review method's mark. It SHALL give numbers, never a recommendation.

#### Scenario: No config
- **WHEN** the script runs with no config file and no `--repo`
- **THEN** it exits 2, naming the config path it looked for, and writes nothing

#### Scenario: A repo of each layout
- **WHEN** one repo holds `.minions/changes/<id>/` and another the old `.minions/findings/` and `runs/<stamp>/` logs
- **THEN** both repos' changes are read, with their cost, and neither is written

#### Scenario: Files from every era
- **WHEN** a repo holds a findings file with no cards, one with cards and no `## Refuted`, a status log, and a file with
  the verdict states and `## Refuted`, with or without a `tier:` line
- **THEN** each record carries what its file holds, every missing field is a gap, and the page lists the gaps per repo

#### Scenario: Cost from the run logs
- **WHEN** a repo's run directory holds a converge log with two result events, a build log with none, and a run log naming two
  converge spawns
- **THEN** the converge cell holds the last cumulative dollars and the summed turns, marked as one log of two, and the build cell
  is a gap

#### Scenario: Tokens per role
- **WHEN** a status log holds `tokens review 45426, security 41346`, `tokens 128126 + 115356`, `tokens 115k (review 63k, security
  52k)` and a line naming one role with `tokens 97960`
- **THEN** each role's tokens are read from its own figure, and none is summed into the other

#### Scenario: A Codex worker
- **WHEN** a Codex session's parent ran in the repo's worktree inside a round's window, its path naming `review`
- **THEN** `review-metrics.json` holds that round's review record with the session's tokens, model and effort, `source:
  codex-session`

#### Scenario: A page from findings
- **WHEN** the script runs over repos with findings
- **THEN** the page holds a section per repo, a table per model, and charts, and no repo has changed

### Requirement: A halt stops only its version, and a re-run resumes

A failed check SHALL halt its version alone: that version SHALL start no new worker but its rescue, and every other version SHALL go on
to its release. A version whose `after:` names a halted or blocked version SHALL be blocked, starting no worker. A failed
probe and a conductor crash SHALL stop the run. A run with every open version at a halt stage or `waiting` SHALL start
no worker, the probe included. A `**HUMAN` phase, a dependency waiting for approval,
converge's cap, an open integrate merge, a red gate, a release stopped before its merge, and a worker past its timeout
SHALL each halt their version.

Each halt SHALL be logged when it happens, and each block as `blocked — by <id>`. A run with a halt or a block SHALL
close on `run · halt — halted <ids> · blocked <ids> · released <tags>` and exit 1. `conduct.py report` SHALL print every
`halt` line, then the closing line, and SHALL end a blocked version's line with `blocked by <id>`. The run SHALL keep no state
outside git and the run directory, except the claim, `origin`'s URLs, the offline base, the release ledger and a person's gate approval
in the home folder: a re-run derives every stage again and continues. A halt SHALL need
the person only at a stage in `HALTS`, a `**HUMAN` phase, a merge with a note, a converge that halted on anything but
`.minions/debt.lock`, or an older `.minions/backlog.lock`, a release whose
base moved, a release stopped on purpose or refused, a repo git config key or local `origin` the run refuses, a git config that
changed during the run, an `origin` that left the kept URLs, an `origin` it cannot read with no offline base, an old
`.minions/backlog.md` beside `.minions/debt.md` or a file at `.minions/backlog.lock`, or one that is a link, or a
default-branch commit no ledger entry stands behind. A worker stopped by a usage limit SHALL be halted with its reset time named.

#### Scenario: A HUMAN phase halts its version
- **WHEN** a version's first unticked phase is marked `**HUMAN`
- **THEN** that version halts, naming the phase, and every other version goes on

#### Scenario: A later version halts, and the earlier ships
- **WHEN** two versions run and the later one's build check fails
- **THEN** the earlier is released, merged and pushed
- **AND** the run closes naming the later as halted and the earlier's tag as released, and exits 1

#### Scenario: A later version ships past a halted one
- **WHEN** two versions run and the earlier one's build check fails
- **THEN** the later is released, merged and pushed
- **AND** the run closes naming the earlier as halted and the later's tag as released, and exits 1

#### Scenario: A halted dependency blocks a chain
- **WHEN** a version halts, a second has it in `after:`, and a third has the second in `after:`
- **THEN** neither starts a worker, each logs `blocked — by <id>`, and the closing line names both as blocked

#### Scenario: No open version can start
- **WHEN** one version sits at a `**HUMAN` phase, and every other is `waiting`
- **THEN** the run starts no worker, and closes naming the first as halted and the others as blocked

#### Scenario: A failed probe stops the run
- **WHEN** the probe's check fails
- **THEN** no version starts a worker, and the run closes naming `run` as halted

#### Scenario: The person re-runs after a halt
- **WHEN** the person handles the halt and runs `mf-ship` again
- **THEN** each version continues from its stage on disk, and the finished stations do not run again

#### Scenario: The person resolves a semantic conflict
- **WHEN** integrate halted on a semantic conflict, with the merge open and its note under `.minions/changes/<change-id>/`
- **THEN** a re-run of `mf-ship` halts again and integrates nothing, whatever the person staged
- **AND WHEN** the person settles it and `/mf-integrate <change-id>` commits the merge
- **THEN** a re-run of `mf-ship` runs the catch-up round, then the release

#### Scenario: The person fixes a red gate
- **WHEN** integrate halted on a red gate, with the merge committed and `.minions/changes/<change-id>/integrate.red` naming it
- **THEN** a re-run of `mf-ship` halts again and integrates nothing
- **AND WHEN** the person commits a fix past the merge
- **THEN** a re-run of `mf-ship` integrates again, gating the fix, then runs the catch-up round and the release

#### Scenario: Grant takes only the cap
- **WHEN** a person runs `/mf-ship grant <change-id>` on a version halted on anything but converge's cap
- **THEN** it exits 2, and records nothing

### Requirement: A version declares what it builds on

`skills/mf-cut-change/SKILL.md` SHALL take `after=<id>[,<id>]`, halting unless each id is an open version with a lower
number, and SHALL write `after: [<ids>]` into `proposal.md`'s frontmatter. A name a design takes from an `after:`
change's design, and a MODIFIED title a delta takes from an `after:` change's delta, SHALL count as present at the cut.
`conduct.py` SHALL start a dependent only once each id has released,
and SHALL then merge the default branch into its cut-only branch, with no agent, running `integrate.py delta` on the open
merge and committing it when the check passes. A requirement the check names SHALL leave the merge open, with its note
under `.minions/changes/<change-id>/`, and halt the version as `integrating`. `mf-build` and `mf-release` SHALL halt unless each id
has `openspec/changes/archive/<id>/` in `HEAD`. `conduct.py status` SHALL print `waiting` for a dependent whose dependency
has not released. An `after:` edited past the cut SHALL stop no other version: an unreleased id that is not lower SHALL
block its version, and an edit that leaves a running version `waiting` SHALL halt it.

#### Scenario: An edit makes a cycle
- **WHEN** two versions name each other in `after:`, or one names itself, and a third is free
- **THEN** the named versions block with no worker, the third ships, and the run closes

#### Scenario: A worker edits its own `after:`
- **WHEN** a build worker adds an unreleased id to its version's `after:`
- **THEN** that version halts on `waiting`, and every other version goes on

#### Scenario: A dependent waits
- **WHEN** a version names a lower open version in `after:`, and `mf-ship` runs
- **THEN** its build starts only after that version's release, on a tree that holds it
- **AND** unrelated versions run in parallel meanwhile

#### Scenario: A dependent's delta edits what its dependency changed
- **WHEN** a dependent's delta modifies a requirement the default branch changed since its base
- **THEN** the merge stays open, the note names both changes, and the version halts with no build
- **AND WHEN** the person settles it and `/mf-integrate <change-id>` commits the merge
- **THEN** a re-run of `mf-ship` builds the version

#### Scenario: A cut names a dependency it cannot have
- **WHEN** `after=` names an id that is merged, unknown, or not lower than the change's
- **THEN** the cut halts, naming it

#### Scenario: A dependent built by hand
- **WHEN** `mf-build` starts on a change whose `after:` id is not in `HEAD`'s archive
- **THEN** it halts, naming `I17`

### Requirement: A re-run recovers what a dead station left

A re-run of `mf-ship` SHALL finish what a dead worker or conductor left. An open merge with no note SHALL be stage
`integrate`. A version with every phase ticked, no converge run begun, and no `.minions/changes/<change-id>/build.done`
naming `HEAD` SHALL be stage `build`, its closing steps left, and SHALL fail the build check: `skills/mf-build/SKILL.md`
SHALL then run its simplify step and the metrics again, restoring first, saved to a patch under `.minions/changes/<change-id>/`, a dirty
tree whose paths are all in the change's range while its `.minions/changes/<change-id>/build.closing` mark names `HEAD`, halting and
restoring nothing on a path outside it, a dirty tree with no such mark, or a patch an earlier save left, and SHALL write that file, naming `HEAD` and
simplify's outcome, only once both are done. Under `merge=yes`, `skills/mf-release/SKILL.md` SHALL restore a tree dirty with only its own fold and a staged
archive move to `HEAD`, then start over; a hand release SHALL keep its clean-tree halt. It SHALL re-enter at its merge after reading its preamble against the archived delta, halting on a flag under `merge=yes` and naming it beside the ask by hand,
tagging `HEAD` first when the tag is missing, when `HEAD` is its release commit, converge was clean at `HEAD~1` and the
default branch has not moved. `conduct.py` SHALL read that stage as `release` only when the run logs show the release
worker died and the person left no `.minions/changes/<change-id>/release.held` mark, and as `released` for any other release tip. It SHALL read `tasks.md` from `HEAD`. It SHALL, at the start of
a run, push the default branch and each merged tag `origin` lacks, only when every first-parent commit past `origin`'s default
branch, as `origin` lists it, is a merge of a tagged release holding that release's tree, whose release commit's parent is a
head the release ledger holds that is not yet on `origin`, and every such tag is on such a release commit, and SHALL else halt, naming the commit or the
tag; an `origin` it cannot read SHALL leave the push waiting, as *A run goes on while origin cannot be reached* says. It
SHALL push the sha it checked, never force, a rejected push halting the run; `status`
SHALL report that work, so a run starts for it. It SHALL make no remote call, merge nothing into a dependent, and read no
tree's status or diff, while the repo's own git config holds a key off its list of keys that name no program, with an
`origin` or without one. It SHALL make no remote call while `origin`'s
fetch or push URL is not a network URL. The claim
`.minions/runs/active` SHALL hold the conductor's pid with its start time, and each worker's process
group with its leader's start time: a pid at or below 1, a dead pid or one that lost its start time is a stale claim, whose
groups a run kills, each only while its leader keeps that start time and names an executor, before it clears the claim and
starts, and `status` SHALL name it. A group that keeps its start time and names no executor SHALL stop the run, naming the
group and keeping the claim, and a run SHALL clear a stale claim before it detaches, so that stop reaches its caller. A start
time SHALL read the same in any zone or locale. A pid `ps` cannot read that still runs is no stale claim: `status`, `run` and
`/mf-ship stop` SHALL exit 2, naming it, and signal nothing, and a run that cannot read its own start time SHALL stop.

#### Scenario: A release dies before its commit
- **WHEN** a release worker dies with its fold staged and the change's folder moved
- **THEN** a re-run reads the stage as `release`, restores the tree, and releases with one tag

#### Scenario: A release dies after its commit
- **WHEN** a release worker dies between its commit and its tag, and the default branch has not moved
- **THEN** a re-run reads the stage as `release`, tags `HEAD`, merges and pushes

#### Scenario: A release dies after its tag
- **WHEN** a release worker dies after its commit and tag, and the default branch has not moved
- **THEN** a re-run merges and pushes
- **AND WHEN** the default branch has moved
- **THEN** the stage is `released`, a halt naming the person's recovery

#### Scenario: A release stopped on purpose stays stopped
- **WHEN** a release tip's worker exited 0 before its merge, or a person ran the release and said no
- **THEN** the stage is `released`, a halt naming `/mf-release`, and a re-run merges nothing

#### Scenario: A tip forges a release
- **WHEN** a version's tip says `chore(release): <tag>` and the tag is on another commit
- **THEN** the stage is `released`, and a re-run merges nothing

#### Scenario: A hand release finds uncommitted edits
- **WHEN** a person runs `mf-release` with edits uncommitted under `openspec/` or in `CHANGELOG.md`
- **THEN** the clean-tree precondition halts, and nothing is restored

#### Scenario: A person takes a flagged release
- **WHEN** a person runs `mf-release` on a release tip whose preamble is flagged
- **THEN** it reads the flag, does not halt on it, and names it beside the ask before the merge

#### Scenario: A release dies before its push
- **WHEN** the default branch is ahead of `origin` with a run's release, and no version is open
- **THEN** `status` names the unpushed work, and a run pushes it and ends on `done`

#### Scenario: A hand release left unpushed
- **WHEN** the default branch holds a release a person merged by hand, and `origin` lacks it
- **THEN** a run halts naming the merge and `git push`, and pushes nothing

#### Scenario: The repo's config names a command
- **WHEN** the repo's own git config holds `remote.origin.uploadpack`, and `origin` exists
- **THEN** `status` exits 1 naming the key, a run halts, and the conductor makes no remote call

#### Scenario: The repo's config holds an unlisted key
- **WHEN** the repo's own git config holds a `hook.*` key, or any key off the list
- **THEN** `status` exits 1 naming the key, a run halts, and no hook runs on a push or a dependent's merge

#### Scenario: A worker plants a filter
- **WHEN** a worker leaves a `filter.*` key in the repo's config, over a stat-dirty tracked file
- **THEN** the check that follows halts its version naming the key, and the filter never runs

#### Scenario: A worker repoints origin at a local repo
- **WHEN** `origin`'s URL is a local path or a `file://` URL
- **THEN** `status` exits 1, a run halts, the conductor makes no remote call, and that repo's hooks do not run

#### Scenario: The conductor is killed
- **WHEN** `.minions/runs/active` holds a dead pid and a live worker group
- **THEN** `status` reads `stale`, and a run kills the group, clears the claim and starts

#### Scenario: A claim outlives a reboot
- **WHEN** a stale claim names a group whose leader's start time is not the one the entry holds
- **THEN** a run leaves that group alive, and clears the claim

#### Scenario: A claimed group names no executor
- **WHEN** a stale claim names a group that keeps its start time, and whose leader names no executor
- **THEN** a run, detached or not, kills the claim's executors, stops naming that group, and keeps the claim

#### Scenario: A running conductor cannot be read
- **WHEN** `ps` prints nothing for the claim's pid, and that process still runs
- **THEN** `status`, `run` and `/mf-ship stop` exit 2 naming the pid, nothing is signalled, and the claim stays

#### Scenario: The time zone changes during a run
- **WHEN** `TZ` differs between the run's write of its start time and a later read
- **THEN** `status` still reads `live`

#### Scenario: A person's local commit on the default branch
- **WHEN** `main` holds a commit that is no merge of a tagged release, and `origin` lacks it
- **THEN** a run halts naming the commit, and pushes nothing

#### Scenario: A merge a release check refused
- **WHEN** `main` holds a merge of a tagged release whose tree is not that release's, and `origin` lacks it
- **THEN** a run halts naming the merge, and pushes nothing

#### Scenario: A person's version-shaped tag
- **WHEN** `main` reaches a `vX.Y.Z` tag `origin` lacks, on no `chore(release): vX.Y.Z` commit
- **THEN** a run halts naming the tag, and pushes nothing

#### Scenario: A flagged release dies
- **WHEN** a release flags its preamble, commits and dies
- **THEN** a re-run halts on the flag before its merge

#### Scenario: A build dies in simplify
- **WHEN** a build worker ticks and commits every phase, marks its closing steps begun, then dies in simplify with an edit
  left uncommitted
- **THEN** a re-run reads the stage as `build`, closing steps left, and its worker saves the edit to a patch, restores it
  and runs simplify again
- **AND** the run converges only after `.minions/changes/<change-id>/build.done` names `HEAD`

#### Scenario: A dirty tree the build did not mark
- **WHEN** every phase is ticked, no `.done` names `HEAD`, and the tree is dirty with no `.closing` mark naming `HEAD`
- **THEN** `mf-build` halts naming the dirty paths, and restores nothing

#### Scenario: A resume finds an earlier patch
- **WHEN** a resume finds the tree dirty while `.closing` names `HEAD`, and `.minions/changes/<change-id>/build.discarded.patch`
  already exists
- **THEN** `mf-build` halts naming the dirty paths and the patch, restores nothing, and leaves the patch as it was

#### Scenario: A build exits without its marker
- **WHEN** a build worker exits 0 with every phase ticked and committed, and no `.done` names `HEAD`
- **THEN** the build check fails, the version halts, and no second build starts

#### Scenario: A build closed before this rule
- **WHEN** a version's phases are all ticked, its converge has begun, and no `.minions/changes/<change-id>/build.done` exists
- **THEN** the stage is read from converge's status log, as before

### Requirement: A station's executor comes from the models file

`.minions/changes/<change-id>/models.toml` MAY name `executor = "claude"` or `"codex"` in any station's table; absent, the station
runs on the run's executor. Integrate SHALL use the `[release]` table. `conduct.py` SHALL halt a version, before its
worker starts, on an `executor` it does not know and on a `codex` station with a `claude-*` model. It SHALL run one probe
worker per distinct executor named across the open versions and the run's own; a failed probe at the start SHALL stop the
run, and one for a joining version SHALL halt only the versions on its executor.
A station on Codex SHALL report no denial, and converge's tokens SHALL read `unavailable`.

#### Scenario: Converge on Codex beside a build on Claude
- **WHEN** a version's models file names `executor = "codex"` under `[converge]`
- **THEN** its converge runs as `codex exec`, and its build and release as `claude -p`
- **AND** the run probes both executors before any station

#### Scenario: A model the executor cannot run
- **WHEN** a table names `executor = "codex"` and `model = "claude-opus-5-5"`
- **THEN** that version halts naming the table, and no worker starts for it

### Requirement: Converge runs one depth

`skills/mf-converge/SKILL.md`, with its worker reference `skills/mf-converge/references/worker.md`, SHALL run one depth: each role's one fresh worker SHALL judge the change from a packet given up
front, reading beyond the diff only to trace a named angle, and SHALL run review's stale-claim, test-cost and coverage-trace
passes itself. It SHALL take no `tier=`, and SHALL halt, naming the parameter as removed, when one is given. The review and
security files' frontmatter SHALL record `mode`, `workers`, `model` and `packet`, and no tier. The cut SHALL write no `tier` into
`.minions/changes/<change-id>/models.toml`; `mf-ship` SHALL read none from it, and SHALL pass none to converge.

#### Scenario: Converge runs
- **WHEN** converge runs
- **THEN** each role is one fresh worker, and the findings files and the status log record no tier

#### Scenario: A tier is given by hand
- **WHEN** a person runs `/mf-converge <change-id> tier=high`
- **THEN** converge halts, naming `tier` as removed, and dispatches no worker

#### Scenario: An old models file holds a tier
- **WHEN** a version's models file's `[converge]` table holds `tier = "high"`
- **THEN** `mf-ship` ignores it, and the converge prompt carries no tier

#### Scenario: A granted round
- **WHEN** the person grants a round past the cap
- **THEN** the converge prompt ends `and grant=yes`, with no tier clause

#### Scenario: A diff is large
- **WHEN** a change exceeds 1,500 changed lines
- **THEN** it is reviewed anyway, and each file's Summary says it is over the standard cap and to consider a split

### Requirement: A halted version is rescued in its run

When a version halts on its build check, its converge cap the run does not grant, or integrate's red gate or note, `conduct.py` SHALL spawn the
`mf-rescue` station in that version's thread, unless its models file's `[rescue]` table says `skip = true`; the station SHALL run on
the `[rescue]` table's executor and model, the `[build]` table's when there is none. `skills/mf-build/SKILL.md` SHALL write
`.minions/changes/<id>/build.halt` on every halt — the sub-task, the stop condition, one line of evidence. `skills/mf-rescue/SKILL.md` SHALL
fix a build halt on a `Verify:` that cannot pass, a reader a deletion missed, a task two readings would build differently, or an
`Verify:` that is not one plain command — a `$(…)`, a shell variable, a loop or a `cd` — with one `docs(<id>): amend the change directory` commit touching only `openspec/changes/<id>/tasks.md` and `design.md`,
never `design.md`'s decisions table, carrying a `Rescue:` trailer; every other halt it SHALL diagnose in `.minions/changes/<id>/rescue.md`.
`conduct.py` SHALL halt the version when the commit touches any other path, and otherwise clear its halt and go on. A version whose
rescue at a converge or integrate halt leaves its stage on disk no halt SHALL stay halted for the run, a rejoin request taking it
back none, the halt naming that stage and a moved `HEAD`: whatever answers the halt on disk while the rescue runs, or before
the run reads its outcome, SHALL count as the rescue's answer, the person's own fix included, and wait for a re-run. A version SHALL
get at most `RESCUES = 3` rescues in a run, and none for a sub-task it rescued before; a timeout, a usage limit and D47's halts that
need the person SHALL get none. The run SHALL log `rescue — <id>: fixed · <sub-task> · <commit>` or `rescue — <id>: diagnosed ·
<file>`, and `report` SHALL print each. The rejoin folder and the grants folder SHALL be read and emptied through a directory file
descriptor opened without following a link.

#### Scenario: A check that cannot pass
- **WHEN** a build halts on a `Verify:` whose search matches a line no task touches
- **THEN** the rescue amends `tasks.md`, the run logs `rescue — fixed`, and the version builds on and releases in the same run

#### Scenario: A decision halt
- **WHEN** a build halts on a design premise the code rules out
- **THEN** the rescue writes `.minions/changes/<id>/rescue.md`, and the version stays halted, its halt naming the file

#### Scenario: A rescue outside the plan
- **WHEN** a rescue's commit touches a file outside `tasks.md` and `design.md`
- **THEN** the version halts, naming the file

#### Scenario: A rescue that answers its cap
- **WHEN** a rescue at a converge cap writes a grant and a rejoin request
- **THEN** the run starts no further converge round, and logs the version still halted

#### Scenario: The same sub-task again
- **WHEN** a version halts again on a sub-task it was rescued from
- **THEN** no rescue runs, and the halt names both

#### Scenario: A link at the rejoin folder
- **WHEN** a worker swaps the rejoin folder for a link to another directory after the run lists it
- **THEN** nothing in that directory is deleted

### Requirement: A verify halt is diagnosed by the run

When a version's converge halt is Step 1.6's `verify: halt`, `conduct.py` SHALL write its diagnosis to `.minions/changes/<id>/rescue.md`
itself, from the halt line, through a file opened without following a link, start no rescue worker, and log `rescue — <id>: diagnosed
· <file>`. The diagnosis, and every rescue proposal `skills/mf-rescue/SKILL.md` writes, SHALL name the command the run takes back:
`conduct.py rejoin <id>` while a run is live, else `/mf-ship`. A version whose models file says `[rescue] skip = true` SHALL get no
diagnosis.

#### Scenario: A `Verify:` changed since the cut
- **WHEN** converge halts at Step 1.6 with `verify: halt`
- **THEN** the run writes the diagnosis with no worker, naming the person's amend commit and the command, and the version stays
  halted

### Requirement: A station keeps a log per spawn

`conduct.py` SHALL write each spawn's worker log to `.minions/changes/<change-id>/logs/<stamp>-<station>.log` for a change, and to
`.minions/runs/<stamp>/run_<station>.log` for the run's own probe, and a later spawn of the same station in the same stamp to
`-<n>.log`, `n` from 2, so no spawn's log overwrites another's; the newest is read by its stamp and `n`, never by the name's sort.

#### Scenario: A converge spawned twice in a run
- **WHEN** a version's converge is spawned, granted a round, and spawned again in the same run
- **THEN** the change's `logs/` holds `<stamp>-converge.log` and `<stamp>-converge-2.log`

### Requirement: Every worktree shares the primary's run directory

Every station and bundled script SHALL resolve the run directory as `.minions/` beside the primary checkout's git
directory — `git rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-common-dir`, its parent — from any worktree of the
repository. `conduct.py` alone SHALL halt on that answer outside the repo it names until a run has kept that repo's URLs: a worker
can write what steers it. Converge and the release SHALL write `.minions/debt.md` only while holding `.minions/debt.lock`,
created with `mkdir`, halting after two minutes of waiting and naming the lock. A run holding the claim SHALL remove a
`debt.lock` older than ten minutes before its first worker, and log it. A run SHALL move an old `.minions/backlog.md` to `debt.md`, and remove a stale `backlog.lock`, at its start, under its
claim, and halt naming them when both files stand, or when beside the old file the old lock is a file or younger than
ten minutes; with no old file, no old lock halts. An old file that is a link SHALL halt, naming it, and the move SHALL NOT
follow it. The move SHALL hold `.minions/debt.lock`, created with `mkdir`, halting naming it when it is held, and SHALL NOT
replace a `debt.md`. Everything about one change SHALL live in `.minions/changes/<change-id>/` — its review, security and status
log files, its diff patch, its models file, integrate's notes, build's marks, rescue's diagnosis, release's `held`, its gate-check
export and its worker logs — each script finding it through one `_change_dir(primary, id)`; `grants/`, `runs/`, `gate/`,
`replay/`, `metrics/` and `debt.md` stay generic. A run SHALL move an old layout's files into it at its start, under its claim,
before any worker, idempotently, leaving every file it does not name; a link at `changes/`, `changes/<change-id>/` or an old file
SHALL halt, naming it, and so SHALL an old file beside its new one. `integrate.py`, `gate_check.py`, `run.py`, `conduct.py grant`, and a
hand-run `mf-release`, `mf-integrate`, `mf-converge` or `mf-build`, finding a file of its change at its old path, SHALL halt, naming
`/mf-ship` to move it, before writing a file at a new path;
`conduct.py status` and `report` SHALL name such a change `old layout`, reading no stage; `review_metrics.py` SHALL read both
layouts.

#### Scenario: A release in a linked worktree after a converge in another
- **WHEN** converge ran in one worktree of a change and the release runs in another worktree of the same repository
- **THEN** the release reads the same findings files, and does not read converge as skipped

#### Scenario: Two converges write the backlog
- **WHEN** a converge reaches Step 9 while another holds `.minions/debt.lock`
- **THEN** it waits, writes once the lock is free, and removes the lock after its write

#### Scenario: A dead worker left the lock
- **WHEN** a run starts and `.minions/debt.lock` is older than ten minutes
- **THEN** the run removes it and logs the removal before its first worker
- **AND WHEN** the lock is younger
- **THEN** the run leaves it

#### Scenario: A run moves an old backlog
- **WHEN** a run starts beside a `.minions/backlog.md` and no `.minions/debt.md`
- **THEN** it moves the file, removes any stale `backlog.lock`, logs both, and a second start moves nothing
- **AND WHEN** both files stand, the old file is a link, or beside it a `backlog.lock` that is a file or younger than ten
  minutes, or a `debt.lock` younger than ten minutes
- **THEN** the run halts, naming them, and starts no worker
- **AND WHEN** no old file stands beside a young `backlog.lock`, or a file there
- **THEN** the run goes on

#### Scenario: A run moves an old layout
- **WHEN** a run starts beside `.minions/findings/<id>_review.md`, `models/<id>.toml`, `build/<id>.done` and a stray `findings/notes.txt`
- **THEN** each moves into `.minions/changes/<id>/`, the stray stays, the version's stage reads as before, and a second start moves nothing

#### Scenario: A hand-run release on an old layout
- **WHEN** `mf-release` runs by hand for a change whose findings sit in `.minions/findings/`
- **THEN** it halts, naming `/mf-ship`, and releases nothing
