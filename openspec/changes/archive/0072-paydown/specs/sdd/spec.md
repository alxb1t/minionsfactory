## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: The skills run the repository's `make gate`

The `mf-build`, `mf-converge`, `mf-integrate` and `mf-release` skills SHALL run the gate as `make gate`, from the repository
root, through `skills/mf-converge/scripts/gate_run.py`, which records a green run in `.minions/gate/<tree>` — the tree, the
dry run's hash, the date and the seconds — and on a later call reuses it when the worktree is clean, its tree is that tree,
and `make -n gate` prints the same lines. A red run SHALL record nothing, and no record SHALL be written through a linked
`.minions/gate` or staged record, and `mf-release`'s gate after its fold SHALL run
fresh. Each SHALL print the output of `make -n gate` before its first gate run in a session. Each SHALL halt,
naming the root `Makefile`, when that file is missing, has no `gate` target, or has a `gate` target that runs
no command. No shipped skill SHALL name `.minions/minions.toml`.

#### Scenario: Every gate-running skill names make gate, and no skill names the toml
- **WHEN** `mf-build`, `mf-converge` or `mf-release` is about to run the gate for the first time in a session
- **THEN** it prints the output of `make -n gate` first
- **AND** it runs `make gate` from the repository root, never a command it found instead

#### Scenario: The repository has no runnable gate
- **WHEN** the root `Makefile` is missing, has no `gate` target, or its `gate` target prints no command under
  `make -n`
- **THEN** the station halts, naming the root `Makefile`

#### Scenario: A station reuses a green gate on the same tree
- **WHEN** a station's gate ran green on a tree, and a later station gates the same tree, clean, with the same dry run
- **THEN** the later station reuses the record and runs no `make gate`
- **AND WHEN** the tree, the dry run or a file in the worktree differs
- **THEN** it runs `make gate`
- **AND WHEN** `mf-release` gates the tree it folded
- **THEN** it runs `make gate`, whatever stands recorded

### Requirement: A person can stop a run

`/mf-ship stop` SHALL end the live run: the conductor, then each worker group in the claim and the claim, then a `halt — stopped
by the person` line in the run log. A group it cannot end SHALL keep the claim, and it SHALL still write that line and
exit 2, naming the group. A re-run SHALL resume from disk, and `conduct.py log --verify` SHALL pass the stopped run. With no live
run it SHALL say so and exit 0.

#### Scenario: A run is stopped
- **WHEN** a person runs `/mf-ship stop` with a worker live
- **THEN** the worker's group is gone, the log's last line is the stop, and `.minions/runs/active` is gone

#### Scenario: A stop meets a group it cannot end
- **WHEN** a person runs `/mf-ship stop`, and a claimed group names no executor or refuses the kill
- **THEN** the conductor is gone, the log's last line is the stop, the command exits 2 naming the group, and the claim stays

#### Scenario: A claim names another process
- **WHEN** the claim's pid is at or below 1, or its process lacks the claim's start time
- **THEN** `status` reads `stale`, and `/mf-ship stop` says no run is live, signals nothing and leaves the claim

### Requirement: The ship station takes cut versions to the default branch

`skills/mf-ship/SKILL.md`, run in the primary checkout of a repo whose `AGENTS.md` declares `Worktrees:`, SHALL take
every open version to the default branch: build, then converge, for every open version at once; then, one version
at a time, in the order they are ready, integrate when its base moved, converge's catch-up round, and release with
`merge=yes`. Converge SHALL always run. Each station SHALL run as a fresh agent process of the executor the models
file names for it, or of the executor running `mf-ship`, in the version's worktree — integrate in the primary — with the model `.minions/models/<change-id>.toml`
names for it, or the executor's default. A worker SHALL run in an OS sandbox, Claude Code's or Codex's workspace-write, its writes reaching the primary and
each open worktree and nothing outside them, under `conduct.py`'s allowlist on Claude Code, extended by `AGENTS.md`'s `Ship
tools:` line, its prompt carrying the shell rules, and SHALL never run with permission prompts bypassed. A denial SHALL
not halt a version by itself: the station's check decides, and the report lists every denial. Starting `mf-ship` SHALL be the person's yes to every
merge and push of the run. `conduct.py` SHALL run its own git with hooks and `core.fsmonitor` off, so a hook a worker
plants does not run at the conductor's rights. At a run's start, a version whose branch holds nothing past its cut commit,
and whose base the default branch has passed, SHALL get the default branch merged in, as a dependent does; a version with
more, an unticked phase and no merge open, whose base the default branch passed changing a gate makefile, `AGENTS.md`,
`CODING_STANDARDS.md` or `CONTRIBUTING.md`, SHALL get the default branch merged in when the merge is clean or its conflicts
are all paths `integrate.py`'s `changelog`, `decisions` and `delta` rules settle, and SHALL else halt, naming the files and
`git -C <tree> merge <default>`; one
with an unticked phase and a merge open with no note SHALL halt, naming `git -C <tree> commit`, unless it is a
dependent whose merge `conduct.py` finishes; any other version SHALL go on from its stage. After a release's check passes, `conduct.py` SHALL
remove the version's worktree, without `--force`, keeping its branch, only when its path is `AGENTS.md`'s `Worktrees:`
path joined with the change id, logging the ignored paths it held, listed by name; a listing that fails SHALL keep the
worktree, logged, and a refusal SHALL be logged, never forced.

#### Scenario: A worker plants a hook
- **WHEN** a `post-commit` hook stands in the repo and `conduct.py` commits a dependent's merge
- **THEN** the hook does not run on that commit

#### Scenario: Two cut versions ship
- **WHEN** two versions are cut, each in its own worktree, and `mf-ship` runs to the end
- **THEN** both are released, merged and pushed, the first ready first, the other integrated and judged by a
  catch-up round first, and only the primary is left

#### Scenario: A ready version ships past a slow one
- **WHEN** two versions run and the lower id is still building when the higher is ready
- **THEN** the higher is released first, and takes the lower number

#### Scenario: A worker runs a command off the list
- **WHEN** a build worker's command is denied by the allowlist and the build's check still passes
- **THEN** the run goes on, and the report lists the denial
- **AND WHEN** the build's check fails
- **THEN** the version halts, and its `halt` line names the denial

#### Scenario: No worktrees are declared
- **WHEN** `mf-ship` starts in a repo whose `AGENTS.md` declares no `Worktrees:`
- **THEN** it halts, naming the missing declaration, and starts no worker

#### Scenario: A version cut before main moved
- **WHEN** a version's branch holds only its cut commit, and the default branch has moved since
- **THEN** the run merges the default branch into it before its first worker, and builds on the merge
- **AND WHEN** the version's build has begun, and the default branch changed `Makefile` since its base
- **THEN** the run merges the default branch in when the merge is clean or conflicts only in `CHANGELOG.md`, and builds on
  the merge
- **AND WHEN** the merge conflicts in a path no rule settles
- **THEN** that version halts before its next worker, naming `Makefile` and the merge to run
- **AND WHEN** every phase is ticked
- **THEN** the version goes on from its stage, and integrate merges the default branch in
- **AND WHEN** a phase is unticked and the merge is open in its worktree with no note
- **THEN** that version halts before its next worker, naming `git -C <tree> commit` to finish the merge
- **AND WHEN** the merge is open with its note
- **THEN** that version halts as `integrating`, naming the note

#### Scenario: A released worktree
- **WHEN** a release's check passes under `mf-ship`
- **THEN** the version's worktree is gone and its branch kept, and the run logs the ignored paths it held
- **AND WHEN** git's worktree entry names a path other than the `Worktrees:` path joined with the change id
- **THEN** nothing is removed, and the run logs it
- **AND WHEN** the worktree's ignored paths cannot be listed
- **THEN** nothing is removed, and the run logs it
- **AND WHEN** the repo's git config holds a key a run refuses, or changed since the run read it
- **THEN** nothing is removed, and the run logs it
- **AND WHEN** the `Worktrees:` path joined with the change id is a link
- **THEN** nothing is removed, and the run logs it
