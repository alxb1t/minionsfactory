## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: The gate holds the structure rules

`make gate` and `make check` SHALL run `tests/test_structure.py`, which holds the structure rules over every Python file under `skills/` and `scripts/`. A script SHALL name only a file of its own folder, a file of the shared home, or — the conductor alone — a station's script. No script SHALL take a name starting with `_` from a file it names. The files a script names SHALL make no cycle. `sandbox-exec`, `caffeinate`, `sysctl` and `ps` SHALL be named only in the files the test lists. `docs/modules.md` SHALL hold one row for each of those files, with its layer and the files it names, and no row for a file that is gone. Each rule SHALL carry a list of today's exceptions in the test, and a listed exception that no longer exists SHALL fail the test.

#### Scenario: A load the map does not declare
- **WHEN** a script names a file of another station that its row in `docs/modules.md` does not list
- **THEN** `tests/test_structure.py` fails naming both files, and the gate is red

#### Scenario: A station loads a station
- **WHEN** a station's script names a script of another station and the pair is on no exception list
- **THEN** the loads rule fails naming the pair

#### Scenario: A private name crosses a file
- **WHEN** a script reads `_name` from a file it names and the pair is on no exception list
- **THEN** the names rule fails naming the file and the name

#### Scenario: A cycle
- **WHEN** two scripts name each other and the cycle is on no exception list
- **THEN** the cycles rule fails naming the files of the cycle

#### Scenario: An OS command outside its files
- **WHEN** a script outside the listed files names `caffeinate`
- **THEN** the OS-command rule fails naming the file and the command

#### Scenario: A file with no row
- **WHEN** a Python file under `skills/` has no row in `docs/modules.md`
- **THEN** the map rule fails naming the file
- **AND WHEN** a row names a file that is gone
- **THEN** the map rule fails naming the row

#### Scenario: A stale exception
- **WHEN** a listed exception no longer exists in the tree
- **THEN** the rule that lists it fails naming the exception, so a list only shrinks
