## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: A skill infers the one active change

`skills/mf-build/SKILL.md`, `skills/mf-converge/SKILL.md` and `skills/mf-release/SKILL.md` SHALL take `change-id`
from their parameter when one is given. When none is given, each SHALL take the candidates from
`git ls-files openspec/changes/`, without `archive/`: no candidate SHALL halt with `no active change`, several SHALL
halt listing them, and exactly one SHALL be used only if the current branch equals its change id, else halt
naming both. The skill SHALL echo the id with
`(inferred:` before any other work, and SHALL NOT forbid inference.

#### Scenario: Build, converge and release each name the inference and its halts
- **WHEN** build, converge or release starts without a `change-id`, one change is active, and the current branch
  is its change id
- **THEN** the skill echoes the id with `(inferred:` and proceeds

#### Scenario: No candidate, several, or another branch
- **WHEN** no change is active, several are, or the current branch is not the one change's branch
- **THEN** the skill halts with `no active change`, listing the candidates, or naming both branches

### Requirement: A cut makes a worktree when the repository declares one

When root `AGENTS.md` declares `Worktrees:` with a path, `skills/mf-cut-change/SKILL.md` SHALL create the version's
branch with `git worktree add -b <change-id> <path>/<change-id> <default-branch>`, the path relative to
the primary checkout, and SHALL write and commit the change directory in that worktree, leaving the primary on the
default branch. When `AGENTS.md` also declares `Workspace setup:` with a command, the cut SHALL run it in the new
worktree, halting on a failure and naming it. A repository that declares no `Worktrees:` SHALL keep the branch
switch in place.

#### Scenario: A repository with worktrees declared
- **WHEN** the cut runs in the primary of a repository whose `AGENTS.md` declares `Worktrees: ../`
- **THEN** the change is committed in `../<change-id>`, a linked worktree on the new branch
- **AND** the primary is still on the default branch, its tree clean

#### Scenario: A repository with no worktrees declared
- **WHEN** `AGENTS.md` declares no `Worktrees:`
- **THEN** the cut switches to the new branch in place, as before

### Requirement: The integrate station merges the default branch into the next version

`skills/mf-integrate/SKILL.md` SHALL, run in the primary checkout, pick the version with the lowest change id among
the unmerged branches named by a change id, halting and naming it when it is not ready — a phase unticked, or converge not clean —
never skipping ahead. It SHALL merge the default branch into that version's worktree, run `make gate` there, commit
the merge with the version's `Change:` trailer, and end with `Next: /mf-converge, then /mf-release`. A red gate SHALL
halt with the merge open and write `.minions/integrate/<change-id>.red`, which the commit deletes. It SHALL NOT
release, tag, push or rebase.

#### Scenario: The next version is ready
- **WHEN** the lowest-id open version has every phase ticked and clean findings files
- **THEN** the station merges the default branch into its worktree, gates the result and commits the merge

#### Scenario: The next version is not ready
- **WHEN** the lowest-id open version has an unticked phase
- **THEN** the station halts, naming that version, and merges nothing

#### Scenario: The merged tree fails the gate
- **WHEN** `make gate` fails on the merged tree
- **THEN** the station halts with the merge open, and `.minions/integrate/<change-id>.red` exists

### Requirement: The plan station checks the line's rules before its first round

Before its first round, `mf-plan` SHALL report as facts: the backlog cards whose trigger the version fires, proposed
for `backlog:`; a recommendation to pay down first when the backlog holds more than ten open cards; whether
the version's bump fits the repository's rule for a patch; the decisions in force the version touches, naming any overturn; a split
when one diff would be too large for review; re-measured facts when continuing a brief written against an older
commit; and, when the target holds `metrics/catalogue.toml`, the metrics past their watch in the latest tracked data
file.

#### Scenario: A version planned in a repo with metrics
- **WHEN** the target has a catalogue and a tracked data file with a metric past its watch
- **THEN** the first round lists that metric as a fact, read from the data file, with no collection run

#### Scenario: A brief continued against a newer commit
- **WHEN** `from=` names a brief whose facts cite an older commit than the default branch's
- **THEN** the station re-measures those facts before its first round

### Requirement: The page classifies each metric against the previous release

The page SHALL compare each metric with the previous release — the tracked data file whose version is the highest
below this change's, or the highest of all for a change with no number yet — and classify it as steady (the change within `noise`), improved or worsened by `better`,
crossed here (the previous value on the good side of `watch`, this one past it), over (both past it), back under,
or new. It SHALL list crossed here, then worsened, then over, then the rest, before the charts. A chart SHALL show
an `unavailable` value as a gap, never as zero. The page SHALL be a self-contained HTML file with inline SVG, and
SHALL be renderable again from any change's data file.

#### Scenario: A metric already over its watch
- **WHEN** a metric was past its `watch` in the previous release and still is
- **THEN** the page classifies it as over, not as crossed here

#### Scenario: A metric with no value
- **WHEN** a metric is `unavailable` in a data file
- **THEN** its chart shows a gap at that version

## REMOVED Requirements

### Requirement: A cut reserves its id and version against every open version branch

**Reason:** a version's number is now assigned at its release.

**Migration:** see *A cut reserves its id against every open version branch*.

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: A cut reserves its id against every open version branch

`skills/mf-cut-change/SKILL.md` SHALL take a change id only when its number is higher than every id under
`openspec/changes/` and `openspec/changes/archive/` on the default branch and on every branch named by a change id and not merged
into it. It SHALL take `bump=minor|patch`, write `bump:` into `proposal.md`'s frontmatter, and assign no number.
Versions SHALL ship in the order they were cut.

#### Scenario: Two cuts while one change is open
- **WHEN** a version branch holding change `0040-x` is not yet merged, and a second cut is asked for id `0040-y`
- **THEN** the cut halts: the id is taken by an open branch

### Requirement: The release assigns the version

`skills/mf-release/SKILL.md` SHALL read `bump:` from the change's `proposal.md`, halting on anything but `minor` or
`patch`, and SHALL take `<tag>` from `skills/mf-release/scripts/next_tag.py`, which SHALL print the next tag after the
highest `vX.Y.Z` tag, or `v0.1.0` when there is none. It SHALL write `version:` into the proposal it archives, before
it collects metrics. `conduct.py` SHALL read a released version's tag from the branch tip's `chore(release): <tag>`,
and SHALL hold no number before it.

#### Scenario: A minor after v0.40.0
- **WHEN** the highest tag is `v0.40.0` and the proposal says `bump: minor`
- **THEN** the release tags `v0.41.0` and the archived proposal holds `version: v0.41`

#### Scenario: A patch after v0.40.0
- **WHEN** the highest tag is `v0.40.0` and the proposal says `bump: patch`
- **THEN** the release tags `v0.40.1` and the archived proposal holds `version: v0.40.1`

#### Scenario: A repository with no version tag
- **WHEN** no tag has the form `vX.Y.Z`
- **THEN** `next_tag.py` prints `v0.1.0`

#### Scenario: A draft page before the release
- **WHEN** the build draws its metrics page and `proposal.md` holds no `version:`
- **THEN** the page reads `unreleased`, and compares with the highest tracked release
