## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: The plan station reads the target without moving it

`skills/mf-plan/SKILL.md` SHALL read the target repository only at a named commit of its default branch, through
`git show`, `git grep`, `git log`, `git ls-tree` and `git diff`, and SHALL read the working tree only for the
gitignored `.minions/backlog.md`. It SHALL NOT switch, check out, stash, reset, commit, branch or edit in the target,
nor run its gate or a metric collection. A helper it dispatches for facts SHALL be held to the same rule, and SHALL
return conclusions citing `path:line` at that commit.

#### Scenario: A build runs in the same checkout
- **WHEN** `mf-plan` gathers facts while another session builds a change on its version branch in that checkout
- **THEN** the checkout's branch, index and working tree are as they were before
- **AND** every fact cites `path:line` at the named commit of the default branch

### Requirement: The plan station checks the line's rules before its first round

Before its first round, `mf-plan` SHALL report as facts: the backlog cards whose trigger the version fires, proposed
for `backlog:`; a recommendation to pay down first when the backlog holds more than ten open cards; whether
`mf-release` can ship the version's form; the decisions in force the version touches, naming any overturn; a split
when one diff would be too large for review; re-measured facts when continuing a brief written against an older
commit; and, when the target holds `metrics/catalogue.toml`, the metrics past their watch in the latest tracked data
file.

#### Scenario: A version planned in a repo with metrics
- **WHEN** the target has a catalogue and a tracked data file with a metric past its watch
- **THEN** the first round lists that metric as a fact, read from the data file, with no collection run

#### Scenario: A brief continued against a newer commit
- **WHEN** `from=` names a brief whose facts cite an older commit than the default branch's
- **THEN** the station re-measures those facts before its first round

### Requirement: The plan station writes the brief after every round

`mf-plan` SHALL require `brief=<path>` and SHALL write the brief there after every round, with the sections: a title
naming the version, its form, its depth (`light` or `hard`) and the date; one bold line; `## Facts`, each with
`path:line` at a named commit; `## Decisions`, one row per settled question; `## Phases`; `## Not in this`;
`## Open`, the frontier still to ask; and `## For the cut`, filled when the frontier is empty. A hard brief SHALL end
on a settled table the person confirmed, with `## Open` removed. `from=<brief>` SHALL continue a brief. The station
SHALL NOT write the brief's path into the target.

#### Scenario: A thread ends mid-grilling
- **WHEN** a session ends after some rounds
- **THEN** the brief holds every settled decision and the open frontier
- **AND** a new session with `from=` continues from it

#### Scenario: No brief path
- **WHEN** `mf-plan` is started without `brief=`
- **THEN** it halts and asks for the path

### Requirement: The cut halts on a light brief

`skills/mf-cut-change/SKILL.md` SHALL halt when the `brief` it is given declares the `light` depth in its title, naming
the brief as not yet hard-grilled.

#### Scenario: A light brief given to the cut
- **WHEN** `mf-cut-change` is started with a `brief` whose title says `light`
- **THEN** it halts before its branch, and names `mf-plan` with `depth=hard` as the next act
