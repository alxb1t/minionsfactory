## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: A re-run recovers what a dead station left

A re-run of `mf-ship` SHALL finish what a dead worker or conductor left. An open merge with no note SHALL be stage
`integrate`. A version with every phase ticked, no converge run begun, and no `.minions/build/<change-id>.done`
naming `HEAD` SHALL be stage `build`, its closing steps left, and SHALL fail the build check: `skills/mf-build/SKILL.md`
SHALL then run its simplify step and the metrics again, restoring first, saved to a patch under `.minions/build/`, a dirty
tree whose paths are all in the change's range while its `.minions/build/<change-id>.closing` mark names `HEAD`, halting and
restoring nothing on a path outside it or a dirty tree with no such mark, and SHALL write that file, naming `HEAD` and
simplify's outcome, only once both are done. Under `merge=yes`, `skills/mf-release/SKILL.md` SHALL restore a tree dirty with only its own fold and a staged
archive move to `HEAD`, then start over; a hand release SHALL keep its clean-tree halt. It SHALL re-enter at its merge after reading its preamble against the archived delta, halting on a flag under `merge=yes` and naming it beside the ask by hand,
tagging `HEAD` first when the tag is missing, when `HEAD` is its release commit, converge was clean at `HEAD~1` and the
default branch has not moved. `conduct.py` SHALL read that stage as `release` only when the run logs show the release
worker died and the person left no `.minions/release/<change-id>.held` mark, and as `released` for any other release tip. It SHALL read `tasks.md` from `HEAD`. It SHALL, at the start of
a run, push the default branch and each merged tag `origin` lacks, only when every first-parent commit past `origin`'s default
branch, as `origin` lists it, is a merge of a tagged release holding that release's tree, whose release commit's parent is a
head the release ledger holds that is not yet on `origin`, and every such tag is on such a release commit, and SHALL else halt, naming the commit or the
tag; an `origin` it cannot read SHALL halt the push. It SHALL push the sha it checked, never force, a rejected push halting the
run; `status`
SHALL report that work, so a run starts for it. It SHALL make no remote call, merge nothing into a dependent, and read no
tree's status or diff, while the repo's own git config holds a key off its list of keys that name no program, with an
`origin` or without one. It SHALL make no remote call while `origin`'s
fetch or push URL is not a network URL. The claim
`.minions/runs/active` SHALL hold the conductor's pid with its start time, and each worker's process
group with its leader's start time: a pid at or below 1, a dead pid or one that lost its start time is a stale claim, whose
groups a run kills, each only while its leader keeps that start time and names an executor, before it clears the claim and
starts, and `status` SHALL name it. A group that keeps its start time and names no executor SHALL stop the run, naming the
group and keeping the claim, and a run SHALL clear a stale claim before it detaches, so that stop reaches its caller. A start
time SHALL read the same in any zone or locale. A pid `ps` cannot read that still runs is no stale claim: `status`, `run` and
`/mf-ship stop` SHALL exit 2, naming it, and signal nothing, and a run that cannot read its own start time SHALL stop.

#### Scenario: A release dies before its commit
- **WHEN** a release worker dies with its fold staged and the change's folder moved
- **THEN** a re-run reads the stage as `release`, restores the tree, and releases with one tag

#### Scenario: A release dies after its commit
- **WHEN** a release worker dies between its commit and its tag, and the default branch has not moved
- **THEN** a re-run reads the stage as `release`, tags `HEAD`, merges and pushes

#### Scenario: A release dies after its tag
- **WHEN** a release worker dies after its commit and tag, and the default branch has not moved
- **THEN** a re-run merges and pushes
- **AND WHEN** the default branch has moved
- **THEN** the stage is `released`, a halt naming the person's recovery

#### Scenario: A release stopped on purpose stays stopped
- **WHEN** a release tip's worker exited 0 before its merge, or a person ran the release and said no
- **THEN** the stage is `released`, a halt naming `/mf-release`, and a re-run merges nothing

#### Scenario: A tip forges a release
- **WHEN** a version's tip says `chore(release): <tag>` and the tag is on another commit
- **THEN** the stage is `released`, and a re-run merges nothing

#### Scenario: A hand release finds uncommitted edits
- **WHEN** a person runs `mf-release` with edits uncommitted under `openspec/` or in `CHANGELOG.md`
- **THEN** the clean-tree precondition halts, and nothing is restored

#### Scenario: A person takes a flagged release
- **WHEN** a person runs `mf-release` on a release tip whose preamble is flagged
- **THEN** it reads the flag, does not halt on it, and names it beside the ask before the merge

#### Scenario: A release dies before its push
- **WHEN** the default branch is ahead of `origin` with a run's release, and no version is open
- **THEN** `status` names the unpushed work, and a run pushes it and ends on `done`

#### Scenario: A hand release left unpushed
- **WHEN** the default branch holds a release a person merged by hand, and `origin` lacks it
- **THEN** a run halts naming the merge and `git push`, and pushes nothing

#### Scenario: The repo's config names a command
- **WHEN** the repo's own git config holds `remote.origin.uploadpack`, and `origin` exists
- **THEN** `status` exits 1 naming the key, a run halts, and the conductor makes no remote call

#### Scenario: The repo's config holds an unlisted key
- **WHEN** the repo's own git config holds a `hook.*` key, or any key off the list
- **THEN** `status` exits 1 naming the key, a run halts, and no hook runs on a push or a dependent's merge

#### Scenario: A worker plants a filter
- **WHEN** a worker leaves a `filter.*` key in the repo's config, over a stat-dirty tracked file
- **THEN** the check that follows halts its version naming the key, and the filter never runs

#### Scenario: A worker repoints origin at a local repo
- **WHEN** `origin`'s URL is a local path or a `file://` URL
- **THEN** `status` exits 1, a run halts, the conductor makes no remote call, and that repo's hooks do not run

#### Scenario: The conductor is killed
- **WHEN** `.minions/runs/active` holds a dead pid and a live worker group
- **THEN** `status` reads `stale`, and a run kills the group, clears the claim and starts

#### Scenario: A claim outlives a reboot
- **WHEN** a stale claim names a group whose leader's start time is not the one the entry holds
- **THEN** a run leaves that group alive, and clears the claim

#### Scenario: A claimed group names no executor
- **WHEN** a stale claim names a group that keeps its start time, and whose leader names no executor
- **THEN** a run, detached or not, kills the claim's executors, stops naming that group, and keeps the claim

#### Scenario: A running conductor cannot be read
- **WHEN** `ps` prints nothing for the claim's pid, and that process still runs
- **THEN** `status`, `run` and `/mf-ship stop` exit 2 naming the pid, nothing is signalled, and the claim stays

#### Scenario: The time zone changes during a run
- **WHEN** `TZ` differs between the run's write of its start time and a later read
- **THEN** `status` still reads `live`

#### Scenario: A person's local commit on the default branch
- **WHEN** `main` holds a commit that is no merge of a tagged release, and `origin` lacks it
- **THEN** a run halts naming the commit, and pushes nothing

#### Scenario: A merge a release check refused
- **WHEN** `main` holds a merge of a tagged release whose tree is not that release's, and `origin` lacks it
- **THEN** a run halts naming the merge, and pushes nothing

#### Scenario: A person's version-shaped tag
- **WHEN** `main` reaches a `vX.Y.Z` tag `origin` lacks, on no `chore(release): vX.Y.Z` commit
- **THEN** a run halts naming the tag, and pushes nothing

#### Scenario: A flagged release dies
- **WHEN** a release flags its preamble, commits and dies
- **THEN** a re-run halts on the flag before its merge

#### Scenario: A build dies in simplify
- **WHEN** a build worker ticks and commits every phase, marks its closing steps begun, then dies in simplify with an edit
  left uncommitted
- **THEN** a re-run reads the stage as `build`, closing steps left, and its worker saves the edit to a patch, restores it
  and runs simplify again
- **AND** the run converges only after `.minions/build/<change-id>.done` names `HEAD`

#### Scenario: A dirty tree the build did not mark
- **WHEN** every phase is ticked, no `.done` names `HEAD`, and the tree is dirty with no `.closing` mark naming `HEAD`
- **THEN** `mf-build` halts naming the dirty paths, and restores nothing

#### Scenario: A build exits without its marker
- **WHEN** a build worker exits 0 with every phase ticked and committed, and no `.done` names `HEAD`
- **THEN** the build check fails, the version halts, and no second build starts

#### Scenario: A build closed before this rule
- **WHEN** a version's phases are all ticked, its converge has begun, and no `.minions/build/<change-id>.done` exists
- **THEN** the stage is read from converge's status log, as before
