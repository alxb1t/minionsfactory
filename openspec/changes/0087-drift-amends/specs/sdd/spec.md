## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: The converge fixer leaves the plan to the person

`skills/mf-converge/SKILL.md`'s fix pass SHALL NOT edit the change's `tasks.md` or `design.md`. A card whose fix needs either SHALL be
set `wontfix`, naming the amend the person commits by the file's path: an **amend card**, as is any card whose **Fix** names the
change's `tasks.md` or `design.md` by path. A blocking amend card SHALL halt the round `amend needed — <card ids>` after the fix
pass. The verify pass SHALL keep an amend card's `wontfix` whose justification holds, and SHALL NOT turn it `accepted`. At Step 9,
before the debt lock, every non-blocking amend card left `wontfix`, or `open` and `drift`, whose **Still true?** check still shows
the defect, SHALL halt the run `amend needed — <card ids>`, writing nothing to the debt, save one *Converge keeps deferred work
in one repository debt file* lets go on. The person's amend answers either halt.
Step 7's verify round SHALL run `gate_check.py` as Step 1.6 does, after the gate.

#### Scenario: A fix that needs a `Verify:` changed
- **WHEN** a blocking card's fix needs a task's `Verify:` edited
- **THEN** the fixer edits neither file, sets the card `wontfix` naming the amend, and the round halts `amend needed`

#### Scenario: Drift that needs the design amended
- **WHEN** the pickup round's fixer sets a `drift` card `wontfix`, naming an amend of the change's `design.md`
- **THEN** the verify pass keeps it `wontfix`, and Step 9 halts `amend needed — <its id>`, writing no card to the debt
- **AND WHEN** a `drift` card found after the pickup names the same amend in its **Fix**
- **THEN** Step 9 halts on it too

#### Scenario: An amend card the check shows gone
- **WHEN** an amend card's **Still true?** check shows the defect gone at Step 9
- **THEN** it is moot, and halts nothing

### Requirement: Converge keeps deferred work in one repository debt file

`skills/mf-converge/SKILL.md` SHALL write every non-blocking card it does not fix, whose **Still true?** check still
shows the defect, to one file, `.minions/debt.md`, under a heading for its change — save an amend card that halts, as *The
converge fixer leaves the plan to the person* says; an amend card whose id an answered `amend needed` halt named, or whose
qualified id already stands in the debt, SHALL go on as every other card. After both verdicts are
clean, and only while a round remains under the cap, it SHALL pick up this run's non-blocking cards whose fix is
sized `one line`, `a test` or `one line and a test`, and every `drift` card, fix them, and verify them in a normal
round. It SHALL NOT name a per-version debt file. It SHALL delete a debt card only when a verified repeat of
it was fixed and the card's **Still true?** check shows the defect gone.

#### Scenario: Converge names the one debt file and the pickup sizes
- **WHEN** both verdicts are clean, a round remains under the cap, pickup has not run in this run, the run is not a
  catch-up round, and open non-blocking cards are sized `one line`, `a test` or `one line and a test`, or are `drift`
- **THEN** converge fixes exactly those cards and verifies them in a normal round

#### Scenario: Converge writes the debt
- **WHEN** the loop ends clean with non-blocking cards still not `verified`
- **THEN** converge writes each one whose **Still true?** check still shows the defect, and whose id is not yet in
  the debt, to `.minions/debt.md` under its change's heading, and to no per-version file
- **AND** it names each moot card, whose check shows the defect gone, in its report
- **AND** it deletes an older card only when a verified repeat of it fixed the defect and its **Still true?**
  check shows the defect gone

#### Scenario: An amend card after its amend
- **WHEN** Step 9 finds an amend card whose **Still true?** check still shows the defect, and an answered `amend needed` halt
  named its id, or its qualified id already stands in the debt
- **THEN** converge writes it to the debt unless its id is there already, and halts nothing
- **AND WHEN** a catch-up run's Step 9 finds an amend card still true that no answered halt named and the debt does not hold
- **THEN** it halts `amend needed — <its id>`

### Requirement: A converge halt answered by the person converges afresh

Every converge `halt` line SHALL end `· head <sha>`, the `HEAD` it halted at. A converge halt other than the debt lock's, or an older backlog lock's,
SHALL be void when its head is both findings files' `head:` and `HEAD` is past it, a descendant that is not it: `conduct.py`'s
stage SHALL be `converge`, and its converge check SHALL not read the old halt. A halt in a catch-up run whose findings files are
both still clean, a Step 1.6 `verify: halt`, and a fix pass's or Step 9's `amend needed` halt SHALL also be void when `HEAD` is past its head and every commit since is the person's `docs(<id>): amend the
change directory`, one parent each, touching only `openspec/changes/<id>/`. A **halt before round 1** — a halt other than a
`verify: halt` in a run with no `start` line, not marked `· grant` — SHALL be void when `HEAD` is past its head, by any commit, and SHALL be re-run when
`HEAD` is its head: `conduct.py`'s stage SHALL be `converge` in both, and it SHALL start no rescue for it. A run SHALL re-run a
version once at the same head: one that halts before round 1 again SHALL stay out for the rest of that run, a rejoin logging it
still halted. Any other halt naming no head, one past the judged head,
and one whose head is no ancestor of `HEAD` SHALL stand. `skills/mf-converge/SKILL.md`, finding its newest run's top line a halt
before round 1, SHALL open a plain new run, with no mark, as a fresh invocation does; finding a void
catch-up halt, or a void `amend needed` halt, with both files clean, it SHALL run the catch-up round again, opening no new round 1,
and SHALL judge an amend there carrying a `Rescue:` trailer in one Step 7 round over its diff, passing only a trailer-less amend by rule;
finding any other void halt, it SHALL open a run marked `· amended`, and
converge from round 1 over the whole change, the findings files restarting at `round: 1`. A run marked `· grant` that resumes
SHALL stay a granted round.

#### Scenario: A gate red before round 1
- **WHEN** converge halts on a red gate before round 1 at head H, writing no `start` line, and the person asks a live run to take
  it back with no new commit
- **THEN** the run takes it back, and converge runs again in a plain new run
- **AND WHEN** it halts before round 1 again in that run
- **THEN** it stays out for the rest of the run, and a rejoin logs it still halted
- **AND WHEN** a commit past H follows
- **THEN** its stage is `converge`

#### Scenario: A fix after a cap halt
- **WHEN** a version halted at the cap, and the person commits a fix on its branch
- **THEN** a run converges it in a new run marked `· amended`, from round 1, with no grant

#### Scenario: A cap halt with no fix
- **WHEN** a version halted at the cap, and `HEAD` is the findings files' `head:`
- **THEN** its stage stays `converge-halted`
- **AND WHEN** the person rewrote the history, so the halted head is no ancestor of `HEAD`
- **THEN** its stage stays `converge-halted`
- **AND WHEN** the cap is a granted round's, in a run with no `start` line, and `HEAD` is its head
- **THEN** its stage stays `converge-halted`, and it is no halt before round 1

#### Scenario: A halt past the judged head
- **WHEN** converge halts after its own fix commit, or in a catch-up run past its `start` line, so its head is not the findings
  files' `head:`, and a commit other than the person's amend follows
- **THEN** its stage stays `converge-halted`, and no `· amended` run opens

#### Scenario: The person's amend answers a catch-up halt
- **WHEN** a catch-up round halts at Step 1.6 on a `Verify:` changed since the cut, and the person commits `docs(<id>): amend the
  change directory`
- **THEN** its stage is `converge`, and the next run's catch-up round counts the merge and the amend as its own

#### Scenario: The person's amend answers a drift halt
- **WHEN** Step 9 halts `amend needed` with both findings files clean, and the person commits `docs(<id>): amend the change
  directory`
- **THEN** its stage is `converge`, and the next run is a catch-up round that passes the person's trailer-less amend by rule,
  with no new round 1

#### Scenario: A granted round resumes
- **WHEN** a granted round dies after its `fix` line, and a re-run resumes it
- **THEN** it verifies and ends with no pickup

### Requirement: A halted version is rescued in its run

When a version halts on its build check, a converge halt — its cap the run does not grant, or `amend needed` among them — or integrate's red gate or note, `conduct.py` SHALL spawn the
`mf-rescue` station in that version's thread, unless its models file's `[rescue]` table says `skip = true`; the station SHALL run on
the `[rescue]` table's executor and model, the `[build]` table's when there is none. `skills/mf-build/SKILL.md` SHALL write
`.minions/changes/<id>/build.halt` on every halt — the sub-task, the stop condition, one line of evidence. `skills/mf-rescue/SKILL.md` SHALL
fix a build halt on a `Verify:` that cannot pass, a reader a deletion missed, a task two readings would build differently, or an
`Verify:` that is not one plain command — a `$(…)`, a shell variable, a loop or a `cd` — and a converge `amend needed` halt with the
amend its cards name — each `wontfix` card's, and each `open` `drift` card's **Fix** — with one `docs(<id>): amend the change directory` commit touching only `openspec/changes/<id>/tasks.md` and `design.md`,
never `design.md`'s decisions table without the version's switch, carrying a `Rescue:` trailer; every other halt it SHALL diagnose in `.minions/changes/<id>/rescue.md`.
An `amend needed` halt naming a security card of `critical` or `high` severity SHALL get a diagnosis alone, whatever the
switch. The rescue SHALL be offered its amend whether the version halted in this run or before it, at the run's start.
`conduct.py` SHALL halt the version when the commit touches any other path, and otherwise clear its halt and go on in the same run, an
`amend needed` halt to a converge run marked `· amended`, or to its catch-up round when both findings files are still clean, where one
Step 7 round judges the rescue's amend. A version whose
rescue at a converge or integrate halt leaves its stage on disk no halt SHALL stay halted for the run, a rejoin request taking it
back none, the halt naming that stage and a moved `HEAD`: whatever answers the halt on disk while the rescue runs, or before
the run reads its outcome, SHALL count as the rescue's answer and wait for a re-run — save the person's
`docs(<id>): amend the change directory` commits, which answer an `amend needed`, `verify: halt` or clean catch-up halt
by amends alone: the version SHALL go on in the run, logged `rescue — <id>: amended · <commit>`. A version SHALL
get at most `RESCUES = 3` rescues in a run, and none for a sub-task it rescued before; a timeout, a usage limit and D47's halts that
need the person SHALL get none. The run SHALL log `rescue — <id>: fixed · <sub-task> · <commit>`, `rescue — <id>: decided ·
<sub-task> · <commit>` or `rescue — <id>: diagnosed · <file>`, and `report` SHALL print each. The rejoin folder and the grants folder SHALL be read and emptied through a directory file
descriptor opened without following a link.

#### Scenario: A check that cannot pass
- **WHEN** a build halts on a `Verify:` whose search matches a line no task touches
- **THEN** the rescue amends `tasks.md`, the run logs `rescue — fixed`, and the version builds on and releases in the same run

#### Scenario: A decision halt
- **WHEN** a build halts on a design premise the code rules out
- **THEN** the rescue writes `.minions/changes/<id>/rescue.md`, and the version stays halted, its halt naming the file

#### Scenario: A rescue outside the plan
- **WHEN** a rescue's commit touches a file outside `tasks.md` and `design.md`
- **THEN** the version halts, naming the file

#### Scenario: A rescue at amend needed
- **WHEN** converge halts `amend needed` on a review card whose fix names a `design.md` prose amend, in the run or before it
- **THEN** the rescue commits that amend, and the version converges again in the same run, in a run marked `· amended`
- **AND WHEN** the card is a security card of `high` severity
- **THEN** the rescue diagnoses, and the version stays halted

#### Scenario: A rescue at a drift halt
- **WHEN** converge's Step 9 halts `amend needed` on an `open` `drift` card whose **Fix** names a `design.md` amend, both findings
  files clean, and the version's models file says `decide = "recommended"`
- **THEN** the rescue commits that amend with its `Rescue:` trailer, and the version goes on in the same run through a catch-up
  round whose one Step 7 round reads the amend, with no new round 1, and releases

#### Scenario: An amend lands during a rescue
- **WHEN** the person commits `docs(<id>): amend the change directory` while the rescue of its `amend needed` halt runs
- **THEN** the version goes on in the same run, and the run logs `rescue — <id>: amended`

#### Scenario: A rescue that answers its cap
- **WHEN** a rescue at a converge cap writes a grant and a rejoin request
- **THEN** the run starts no further converge round, and logs the version still halted

#### Scenario: The same sub-task again
- **WHEN** a version halts again on a sub-task it was rescued from
- **THEN** no rescue runs, and the halt names both

#### Scenario: A link at the rejoin folder
- **WHEN** a worker swaps the rejoin folder for a link to another directory after the run lists it
- **THEN** nothing in that directory is deleted

### Requirement: The release ships only a reviewed head

When converge ran, `skills/mf-release/SKILL.md` SHALL halt unless `HEAD` equals the `head:` of both findings files.
`skills/mf-converge/SKILL.md` SHALL offer a **catch-up round**: when both findings files are clean and their `head:`
is an ancestor of `HEAD` but not `HEAD`, it runs one verify round over `head..HEAD`, with no pickup, unless the
selection is merges and amends only, every merge replays by the fixed rules and no amend carries a `Rescue:` trailer, when
the round is by rule and runs no worker.
**Merges and amends** are merges, and the person's or the rescue's `docs(<id>): amend the change directory` commits touching only
`openspec/changes/<id>/`. When the selection is merges and amends only, the run SHALL count its own rounds: one judge round and
at most one fix round, then a halt, with `round:` carrying on past three. Any other selection SHALL count against the cap of three.
When that range holds a merge of the default branch, the round SHALL judge the merge by its
`git show --remerge-diff`, and the range's other commits by their own diff, not the changes the merge brought in.

#### Scenario: The release compares HEAD with the judged head, and converge names the catch-up round
- **WHEN** converge ran and `HEAD` differs from the `head:` of either findings file
- **THEN** `mf-release` halts, and names `/mf-converge` and its catch-up round as the next act

#### Scenario: Converge catches up
- **WHEN** both findings files are clean and their `head:` is an ancestor of `HEAD` but not `HEAD`
- **THEN** `mf-converge` runs one verify round over `head..HEAD`, with no pickup
- **AND WHEN** the selection is merges and amends only, every merge replays by the fixed rules and no amend carries a
  `Rescue:` trailer
- **THEN** the round is by rule: no freeze, no worker, no verify round, and no pickup

#### Scenario: The catch-up round judges a merge-in by what the merge decided
- **WHEN** the range `head..HEAD` holds a merge of the default branch whose conflicts were resolved by hand
- **THEN** the round's patch holds that merge's remerge-diff, not the default branch's changes
- **AND** a merge with no conflicts adds nothing to read, and the gate judges the combined tree

#### Scenario: A catch-up over merges only has its own count
- **WHEN** the last judged round is 3 and the selection is the integrate merge alone
- **THEN** `mf-converge` judges it as round 4, with no halt at the cap
- **AND WHEN** a blocking finding is still open after its one fix round
- **THEN** it halts with `cap reached`, and the stage reads `converge-halted`

#### Scenario: A catch-up over a merge and the person's amend has its own count
- **WHEN** the last judged round is 3 and the selection is the integrate merge and the person's amend of the change directory
- **THEN** `mf-converge` judges it as round 4, with no halt at the cap

#### Scenario: A rescue's amend at round 3 has its own count
- **WHEN** the last judged round is 3, Step 9 halted `amend needed`, and the selection is the rescue's amend of the change
  directory, carrying its `Rescue:` trailer
- **THEN** `mf-converge` judges it in one Step 7 round as round 4, with no halt at the cap and no round by rule

#### Scenario: A late commit at the cap halts
- **WHEN** the last judged round is 3 and the selection holds a commit that is neither a merge nor the person's or the
  rescue's amend
- **THEN** `mf-converge` halts, naming the revert and the re-converge from round 1

### Requirement: Anchored harms block, and drift has its own tier

`skills/mf-converge/references/worker.md`, converge's worker reference, SHALL name the **anchors** — data loss or an irreversible delete, spend, exposure of
personal data or secrets, silent wrong output — and SHALL grade an anchored finding `blocking` in review and at least
`high` in security, save a route in a class the threat model's *Out of scope* accepts by name, which is carded and does
not block, anchors included. Review SHALL grade `blocking | drift | nit`, where `drift` is docs, comments, README or CHANGELOG
text the code contradicts; `drift` SHALL NOT block, save an amend card, on which converge halts at Step 9. A spec scenario the
code contradicts SHALL stay `blocking`.

#### Scenario: Converge and the method page name the anchors and the drift tier
- **WHEN** review or security finds data loss or an irreversible delete, spend, exposure of personal data or
  secrets, or silent wrong output
- **THEN** review grades it `blocking` and security at least `high`, so the loop fixes it

#### Scenario: Prose the code contradicts
- **WHEN** review finds docs, comments, README or CHANGELOG text the code contradicts
- **THEN** it grades the finding `drift`, which does not block, save an amend card, on which converge halts at Step 9
- **AND** a spec scenario the code contradicts stays `blocking`

#### Scenario: A route in the accepted class
- **WHEN** security finds a route in a class the threat model's *Out of scope* accepts by name, with an anchored harm
- **THEN** it cards the route, and the card does not block

### Requirement: A catch-up over a merge the fixed rules reproduce is clean by recomputation

`skills/mf-integrate/scripts/integrate.py replay <merge>` SHALL rebuild the merge from its parents in a scratch worktree, settle
its conflicts with the `changelog` and `decisions` rules alone, run the `delta` rule, and exit 0 when `delta` names no requirement
and the rebuilt tree equals the merge's tree, else 1. Its git SHALL run no hook and fetch no missing object.
It SHALL exit 2, rebuilding nothing, for a commit without two parents or whose second parent the default branch does not hold.
`skills/mf-converge/SKILL.md`'s catch-up round SHALL first run *Catch-up scope*'s ancestry and parent checks, halting when one
fails, then run `replay` for each merge in its selection; when every merge replays and the selection holds nothing else but the
person's amends, none carrying a `Rescue:` trailer, which Step 1's gate and `gate_check.py` judge, it SHALL write both findings
files `head: HEAD` and `verdict: clean` with a `## By rule` section naming each merge's paths and each amend, log
`round N · by rule — clean, <paths>`, dispatch no worker, and count the round within the merges-and-amends count. Any other
selection, one holding the rescue's amend among them, SHALL take the catch-up round as before.

#### Scenario: A changelog the rule settled
- **WHEN** the integrate merge conflicted in `CHANGELOG.md` alone, settled by `integrate.py changelog`
- **THEN** the catch-up replays it, writes both findings files clean with `## By rule`, dispatches no worker, and the release
  passes its preconditions

#### Scenario: A merge and the person's amend
- **WHEN** the selection is a merge that replays and the person's amend of the change directory, and Step 1 passes
- **THEN** the catch-up writes both findings files clean with `## By rule`, naming the merge and the amend, and dispatches no worker

#### Scenario: A merge and the rescue's amend
- **WHEN** the selection is a merge that replays and the rescue's amend of the change directory, carrying its `Rescue:` trailer
- **THEN** the catch-up writes no `## By rule`, and one Step 7 round dispatches review and security over the selection

#### Scenario: A merge someone judged
- **WHEN** the merge holds a hunk the integrator resolved as a union, a person's resolution, a test edited, or a requirement
  the delta edits that the default branch changed
- **THEN** replay exits 1, and the catch-up round dispatches review and security as before

#### Scenario: A merge of a commit the default branch does not hold
- **WHEN** the merge's second parent is not an ancestor of the default branch, though git merged it with no conflict
- **THEN** replay exits 2, and the catch-up halts, naming the merge, with no findings file written clean
