## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: The release merges and pushes on the person's yes

`skills/mf-release/SKILL.md` SHALL halt before it folds, archives, commits or tags when the default branch is not an
ancestor of `HEAD`, naming the merge-in: `/mf-integrate`, then converge's catch-up round when converge ran, then the release
again. The default branch SHALL be the one `git symbolic-ref --short
refs/remotes/origin/HEAD` names after `origin/`, or `main`. It SHALL, after the tag, ask the person once whether to
merge and push. Given `merge=yes`, it SHALL NOT ask: `merge=yes` is the yes, given once by the person who started
`mf-ship`; and it SHALL halt before the merge when Step 2 flagged a hand-edit. When the release runs in a linked
worktree other than the primary, that one ask SHALL name the
worktree and the ignored paths it holds, listed by name without reading file contents. On yes it SHALL halt when the
default branch is not an ancestor of the branch, naming the person's
recovery — the tag deleted and the release commit reset, by the person — then merge with `--no-ff` in the worktree
that holds the default branch, halting when that worktree's tree is not clean, check that the merged tree equals the
branch's, and push the default branch and the tag to `origin`, except under `merge=yes`, where `conduct.py` pushes. After the merge it SHALL remove the worktree the ask
named, without `--force`, keeping its branch, except under `merge=yes`, where `conduct.py` removes it. A listing that fails SHALL be named in the ask, and the worktree
retained. A worktree that refuses removal is reported, not forced. Its close-out SHALL name the worktree removed,
kept or refused. It SHALL never force a push, never push
the version branch, and SHALL merge without pushing when there is no `origin`. On anything but yes it SHALL print
the commands and stop.

#### Scenario: The release names the merge and its guards
- **WHEN** the tag is made and the person answers yes to `Merge <branch> into <default-branch> and push?`
- **THEN** `mf-release` halts if the default branch is not an ancestor of the branch, merges with `--no-ff`,
  checks the merged tree equals the branch's, and pushes the default branch and the tag without `--force`

#### Scenario: The person says anything else, or there is no origin
- **WHEN** the answer is not yes
- **THEN** the release prints the merge and push commands and stops
- **AND WHEN** the answer is yes and there is no `origin`
- **THEN** it merges and does not push

#### Scenario: The base moved before the release
- **WHEN** the default branch has a commit the version branch lacks when the release starts
- **THEN** it halts before the fold, the commit and the tag, naming `/mf-integrate`, the catch-up round and the release
  again

#### Scenario: A release run in a linked worktree
- **WHEN** the version branch is checked out in a linked worktree and the primary holds the default branch
- **THEN** the release merges in the primary, never switching branches in the version's worktree
- **AND** it removes the version's worktree after the merge, the branch kept

#### Scenario: A version's worktree contains ignored local files
- **WHEN** the version's worktree holds ignored paths, such as `.venv/` and the test caches
- **THEN** the ask names each path without reading its contents, and on yes the release removes the worktree with
  them, without `--force`
- **AND WHEN** the listing fails
- **THEN** the ask names the failure, and the release retains the worktree

#### Scenario: The conductor gives the yes
- **WHEN** the release is run with `merge=yes` and Step 2 flagged nothing
- **THEN** it asks nothing, merges as on a yes, and `conduct.py` pushes and removes the worktree
- **AND WHEN** Step 2 flagged a hand-edit
- **THEN** it halts after the tag and before the merge, naming the flagged prose

#### Scenario: A release under mf-ship leaves its worktree to the conductor
- **WHEN** a release under `merge=yes` merges
- **THEN** it removes no worktree, and its close-out says `conduct.py` removes it

### Requirement: The release records the gate's time

`skills/mf-release/SKILL.md` SHALL time precondition 1's gate run and SHALL write one `Gate:` line under the new
release heading in `CHANGELOG.md`: that time, CI's latest green run on the default branch read with `gh run list`
or `none`, and the previous release's `Gate:` line's times. Under `merge=yes` the CI part SHALL read `CI not read under
mf-ship`: the sandbox keeps `gh` from its config.

#### Scenario: The release names the line and the CI read
- **WHEN** `mf-release` renames `## [Unreleased]` to the release heading
- **THEN** it writes one `Gate:` line under it: precondition 1's timed run, CI's latest green run on the default
  branch from `gh run list` or `none`, and the previous release's `Gate:` times

#### Scenario: A release under mf-ship
- **WHEN** a release under `merge=yes` writes its `Gate:` line
- **THEN** the CI part reads `CI not read under mf-ship`, never `CI none`

### Requirement: The ship station takes cut versions to the default branch

`skills/mf-ship/SKILL.md`, run in the primary checkout of a repo whose `AGENTS.md` declares `Worktrees:`, SHALL take
every open version to the default branch: build, then converge, for every open version at once; then, one version
at a time, in the order they are ready, integrate when its base moved, converge's catch-up round, and release with
`merge=yes`. Converge SHALL always run. Each station SHALL run as a fresh agent process of the executor the models
file names for it, or of the executor running `mf-ship`, in the version's worktree — integrate in the primary — with the model `.minions/models/<change-id>.toml`
names for it, or the executor's default. A worker SHALL run in an OS sandbox, Claude Code's or Codex's workspace-write, its writes reaching the primary and
each open worktree and nothing outside them, under `conduct.py`'s allowlist on Claude Code, extended by `AGENTS.md`'s `Ship
tools:` line, its prompt carrying the shell rules, and SHALL never run with permission prompts bypassed. A denial SHALL
not halt a version by itself: the station's check decides, and the report lists every denial. Starting `mf-ship` SHALL be the person's yes to every
merge and push of the run. `conduct.py` SHALL run its own git with hooks and `core.fsmonitor` off, so a hook a worker
plants does not run at the conductor's rights. At a run's start, a version whose branch holds nothing past its cut commit,
and whose base the default branch has passed, SHALL get the default branch merged in, as a dependent does; a version with
more, an unticked phase and no merge open SHALL halt when the default branch changed a gate makefile, `AGENTS.md`,
`CODING_STANDARDS.md` or `CONTRIBUTING.md` since its base, naming the files and `git -C <tree> merge <default>`; any
other version SHALL go on from its stage. After a release's check passes, `conduct.py` SHALL
remove the version's worktree, without `--force`, keeping its branch, only when its path is `AGENTS.md`'s `Worktrees:`
path joined with the change id, logging the ignored paths it held, listed by name; a listing that fails SHALL keep the
worktree, logged, and a refusal SHALL be logged, never forced.

#### Scenario: A worker plants a hook
- **WHEN** a `post-commit` hook stands in the repo and `conduct.py` commits a dependent's merge
- **THEN** the hook does not run on that commit

#### Scenario: Two cut versions ship
- **WHEN** two versions are cut, each in its own worktree, and `mf-ship` runs to the end
- **THEN** both are released, merged and pushed, the first ready first, the other integrated and judged by a
  catch-up round first, and only the primary is left

#### Scenario: A ready version ships past a slow one
- **WHEN** two versions run and the lower id is still building when the higher is ready
- **THEN** the higher is released first, and takes the lower number

#### Scenario: A worker runs a command off the list
- **WHEN** a build worker's command is denied by the allowlist and the build's check still passes
- **THEN** the run goes on, and the report lists the denial
- **AND WHEN** the build's check fails
- **THEN** the version halts, and its `halt` line names the denial

#### Scenario: No worktrees are declared
- **WHEN** `mf-ship` starts in a repo whose `AGENTS.md` declares no `Worktrees:`
- **THEN** it halts, naming the missing declaration, and starts no worker

#### Scenario: A version cut before main moved
- **WHEN** a version's branch holds only its cut commit, and the default branch has moved since
- **THEN** the run merges the default branch into it before its first worker, and builds on the merge
- **AND WHEN** the version's build has begun, and the default branch changed `Makefile` since its base
- **THEN** that version halts before its next worker, naming `Makefile` and the merge to run
- **AND WHEN** every phase is ticked, or a merge is open in its worktree
- **THEN** the version goes on from its stage, and integrate merges the default branch in

#### Scenario: A released worktree
- **WHEN** a release's check passes under `mf-ship`
- **THEN** the version's worktree is gone and its branch kept, and the run logs the ignored paths it held
- **AND WHEN** git's worktree entry names a path other than the `Worktrees:` path joined with the change id
- **THEN** nothing is removed, and the run logs it
- **AND WHEN** the worktree's ignored paths cannot be listed
- **THEN** nothing is removed, and the run logs it

### Requirement: The ship station judges every station from disk

`skills/mf-ship/scripts/conduct.py` SHALL decide each version's stage from git and the run directory alone, and SHALL
pass a station only when the worker exits 0 and its check on disk passes — never on the worker's report. The converge
check SHALL need `done` as the newest run's latest status-log event. Before the
first station it SHALL run a probe worker that must edit, commit and run `make gate` in a scratch repo, or halt. The scratch
gate's recipe SHALL try a write to a file `conduct.py` made outside the worker's reach, and SHALL pass only when that write is
refused; `conduct.py` SHALL halt the run when the file changed, and SHALL remove it. The recipe SHALL also pass only
when the shell's `uname -m` is the host's native architecture, so a worker whose shell runs translated halts the run, naming
its executor.
It SHALL log every worker's start, end and check to `.minions/runs/<stamp>.md`, and `conduct.py log --verify` SHALL
fail on a worker with no end, a run that ends on neither `halt` nor `done`, or an unknown event.

#### Scenario: A worker reports success that disk does not show
- **WHEN** a build worker exits 0 and a `## Progress` box is still unticked
- **THEN** the build check fails and the version halts

#### Scenario: A run's log is complete
- **WHEN** a run ends
- **THEN** `conduct.py log --verify` exits 0 on its log

#### Scenario: A worker dies after clean findings
- **WHEN** a converge worker exits 1 with both findings files clean at `HEAD` and no `done` in its status log
- **THEN** the version halts, naming the exit, and nothing is released

#### Scenario: A probe worker runs unsandboxed
- **WHEN** the probe worker's write outside its reach lands
- **THEN** the run halts naming the probe's executor, no version starts a worker, and the file is gone

#### Scenario: A worker's shell runs translated
- **WHEN** the probe worker's shell reports `x86_64` on an `arm64` host
- **THEN** the run halts, naming the executor and both architectures, and no version starts a worker
